Title: 'Minari' review: Steven Yeun stars in a movie that explores one family's American dream

Text: (CNN) "Minari" is a deeply personal film, and quality that's evident in writer-director Lee Isaac Chung's reminiscence about his childhood. Focusing on a Korean immigrant family, the universal themes come through loud, clear and ultimately with considerable power, even if the movie's languid pace works against it. The title refers to a particularly durable crop, which is indicative of the resilience of this family, which has come to rural Arkansas seeking a better life. The father ("The Walking Dead's" Steven Yeun) has big dreams, having essentially bet everything on acquiring a mobile home and farming the adjacent land. He and his wife (Yeri Han) work in a nearby factory engaged in the tedious process of "sexing" chickens by day, and she's understandably skeptical about whether his drive and optimism will be enough to achieve his grand plan. They also have a couple of kids, including a sensitive young son, David (Alan S. Kim), whose health problems provide another source of understandable concern. With both parents working to keep the lights on (literally, given their water-and-power issues), it's a relief when grandma (Youn Yuh Jung) comes to stay with them, even if her behavior isn't deemed maternal enough to satisfy the judgmental boy. Playing a character who's foul-mouthed and frank, Youn comes pretty close to stealing the show, although the performances -- especially Han -- are strong across the board, among them Will Patton as an eccentric neighbor who winds up working for them.
