Title: Opinion: Entrepreneurs in Africa have great ideas. This will help them compete on a global stage

Text: Eleni Giokos is a CNN correspondent based in the network's Johannesburg bureau. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. Last month, I decided to treat myself to a pair of Kenyan-made Enda running shoes. I'm no marathon runner, but lockdown has inspired me to up the ante in my exercise regimen, and who better to trust with my feet than Kenya, home of the kings and queens of distance running? My Endas cost 13,000 Kenyan shillings, which is around $117 US — not exactly cheap, but it still undercuts a few big-name competitors. However, there was a catch: Delivery service DHL said it could only dispatch the shoes to my home in South Africa if I paid 879 South African rand — around $58 — in import tariffs. That's about half the value of the shoes. The import duty priced out the African-made shoe and handed the advantage back to Enda's big global competitors. As it happens, I went ahead with my order, but others may have been put off. In many ways, it summed up the experience of high costs and logistical challenges that has held back intra-Africa trade. Back in 1990, Africa's intra-regional trade languished at around 5% of total African imports, according to the International Monetary Fund. That had improved to 12% by 2017, but there it has remained, well below intra-Asia and intra-European trade. Africa trades far more with Europe than it does internally.
