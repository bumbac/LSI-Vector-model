Title: Ethiopian leader says troops who raped civilians in Tigray will be held to account after CNN investigation

"Reports indicate that atrocities have been committed in Tigray region," Abiy wrote in a post on his Twitter account. "Regardless of the TPLF propaganda of exaggeration, any soldier responsible for raping our women & looting communities in the region will be held accountable as their mission is to protect," he said, referring to the Tigray People's Liberation Front, the region's ruling party, which is now leading a resistance against Ethiopian and Eritrean forces in the area.

Forces from neighboring Eritrea are participating in the military campaign on the side of Ethiopia's government, as CNN has previously reported. CNN unveiled medical records and testimony from survivors, alleging that women were being gang-raped, drugged and held hostage by soldiers.
