Title: How Rwanda's gray crowned cranes escaped a life as status symbol pets

(CNN) In Rwanda's lush green grasslands, romance isn't dead, but it's had a brush with extinction in recent years. The country's gray crowned cranes -- birds which dance for each other, often pair for life and share chick-raising duties -- fell victim to their own popularity. Captured as chicks and kept as status symbol pets in the gardens of hotels and private homes, the birds were almost wiped out. Destruction of their habitat for agriculture added to the pressure and by 2012, only around 300 remained in the wild. Gray crowned cranes dance together as part of their mating ritual and often mate for life. But the species has undergone a remarkable recovery in Rwanda thanks to local vet and conservationist Olivier Nsengimana. Living in Rwanda's capital, Kigali, Nsengimana had found it strange to hear cranes calling from people's gardens, while wild habitats were almost devoid of the birds. "I told myself someone has got to do something about it," he says. "Someone has got to make a change." Gray crowned cranes are still at risk in other parts of Africa. Nsengimana says there's no "copy and paste" solution for all countries, but lessons can be learned from Rwanda's success.
