How to watch the Marvel movies in order – release order (Image credit: Disney) Best for: Newcomers to the Marvel movies. First up, here's how to watch the Marvel movies in release order. Marvel films, we should note, are split into Phases, with the end of a Phase typically indicating a natural end to a story arc. The beginning of a Phase, therefore, signals the introduction of new, important characters. Below, we go through Phases 1 to 4 in release order (but only if they've actually been released, so no Black Widow... yet). Yes, that includes WandaVision/Falcon and The Winter Soldier. No, they're not technically movies, but the MCU is changing so rapidly that the TV shows are now as important as its box office big brothers.

Want to experience the MCU in a more complicated, yet still viable way? Then you'll perhaps want to know how to watch the Marvel movies in chronological order. This one's a little more complicated than the above list. Luckily, Marvel has revealed the official year in which each movie takes place. That goes right up to WandaVision, which fits snugly in-between Endgame and Far From Home. 1. Captain America: The First Avenger (1942-1943) 2. Captain Marvel (1995) 3. Iron Man (2010) 4. Iron Man 2 (2011) 5. The Incredible Hulk (2011) 6. Thor (2011) 7. The Avengers (2012) 8. Iron Man 3 (2012) 9. Thor: The Dark World (2013) 10. Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) 11. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) 12. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 (2014) 13. Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) 14. Ant-Man (2015) 15. Captain America: Civil War (2016) 16. Spider-Man: Homecoming (2016) 17.

Spider-Man: Far From Home (2024) How to watch the Marvel movies AND TV shows in chronological order (Image credit: ABC/Marvel) Best for: People with A LOT of time on their hands who know the MCU inside out. The MCU also consists of a fair few non-Disney Plus TV shows, though their place in a watch order can be somewhat confusing. For instance, we know the Netflix shows – such as Daredevil – take place after the first Avengers, but there's no signal where they come in regards Ultron or Civil War or any of the other major movies. Their ties to canon are tenuous and are certainly not connected to the overall MCU anymore in the way that WandaVision is. To work out the following list, therefore, we used all the clues we could find in the various series, plus some official information from Marvel. For a more detailed explanation, head over to our full MCU timeline explained article, which includes some reasoning around plot holes and the like. We also have a few notes below to help you out. Phase 1: This one's actually fairly straight forward, as only includes one TV show (Agent Carter) but a bunch of one-shots which were released with the DVDs and Blu-Rays (though have seemingly since been retired by Marvel). Captain America: The First Avenger (1943-45) One Shot: Agent Carter (1944) Agent Carter season 1 (1946) Agent Carter season 2 (1947) Captain Marvel (1995) Iron Man (2010) Iron Man 2 (2011) The Incredible Hulk (2011) One Shot: The Consultant (2011) One Shot: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor’s Hammer (2011) Thor (2011) Avengers (2012) One Shot: Item 47 (2012) (Image credit: Marvel) Phase 2: Introducing the Netflix series and Agents of Shield. The events of Shield tie directly into the Marvel movies, which makes watching the show and the films side-by-side a lot of fun. Iron Man 3 (2012) One Shot: All Hail the King (2013) Agents of Shield season 1, episodes 1-7 (2013) Thor: The Dark World (2013) Agents of Shield season 1, episodes 8-16 (2014) Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) Agents of Shield season 1, episodes 17-22 (2014) Daredevil season 1 (2014) Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) Guardians of the Galaxy 2 (2014) Agents of Shield season 2, episodes 1-19 (2015) Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) Agents of Shield season 2, episodes 20-22 (2015) Ant-Man (2015) Jessica Jones season 1 (2015) Daredevil season 2 (2015) Luke Cage season 1 (2015) Agents of Shield season 3 episodes 1-10 (2015) Agents of Shield season 3, episodes 11-19 (2016) (Image credit: Marvel Studios/Disney) Phase 3: Here's where things get more complicated. The Netflix series reference the movies less and less, as does Shield. Plus, we are introduced to time travel... Most of the TV series do not have any official placement, so we've simply tried to place them best we can, using what we know from each show. Agents of Shield season 7 flies around in time a lot, with some events taking place in the 30s, 40s, 50s. So, why aren't they in that order here? If you watch the series, you'll realise the main team are "out of time" as they go back, and you can only understand their mission if you have watched the movies and seen the events that transpire – as the team has. Plus, having a solo entry here keeps things simple! And, as we go forward into Phase 4 and 5, we're going to want to keep things simple, that's for sure. Captain America: Civil War (2016) Agents of Shield season 3, episodes 20-22 (2016) Agents of Shield season 4, episodes 1-8 (2016) Agents of Shield: Slingshot (2016) Agents of Shield season 4, episodes 9-22 (2016) Iron Fist season 1 (2016) The Defenders (2016) Spider-Man: Homecoming (2016) The Punisher season 1 (2016) Doctor Strange (2016-2017) Agents of Shield season 5, episodes 1-19 (2017) Black Panther (2017) Black Widow (2017) Jessica Jones season 2 (2017) Inhumans season 1 (2017) Luke Cage season 2 (2017) Iron Fist season 2 (2017) Daredevil season 3 (2017) The Punisher season 2 (2017) Jessica Jones season 3 (2017) Runaways season 1 and 2 (2017) Cloak and Dagger season 1 and 2 (2017) Helstrom (2017) Thor: Ragnarok (2017-2018) Agents of Shield season 5, episodes 19-22 (2018) Agents of Shield season 6 (2018) Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) Avengers: Infinity War (2017-2018) Avengers: Endgame (2018-2023) WandaVision (2023) Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2023) Agents of Shield season 7 (2023) Spider-Man: Far From Home (2023-2024) Which Marvel movies are on Disney Plus?
