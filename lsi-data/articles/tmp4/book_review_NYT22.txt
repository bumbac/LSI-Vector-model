Title: They Always Had Paris — So He Went Back There Without Her

Text: PARIS WITHOUT HER A Memoir By Gregory Curtis  Following the death of my wife, Aura, who was fatally injured while bodysurfing in Mexico, I received a signed copy of a grief memoir along with a personal note from its famous author, who advised, “Read lots of poetry.” Since then, I’ve passed that advice on, sometimes with a copy of the grief book I wrote. Early on, only poetry could give concrete expression to my lost love’s not-thereness, and to raw grief. But that author and I both turned our struggles into prose. “The bereaved cannot communicate with the unbereaved,” is an oft-quoted sentence by Iris Murdoch, expressed by a character in “An Accidental Man,” who in the next sentence reflects, “Only one is not bereaved for long.” Prose often focuses on whatever it might take to emerge from bereavement, however long endured. In Gregory Curtis’s memoir “Paris Without Her,” inspired by the death of his wife of many years, Tracy, he describes “drowning in waves of grief.” But on the same page he declares, “I wanted to use memories of all our good times to try to reconcile our past together with my future alone.” Memoirs of grief typically narrate a struggle to recover a sense of life’s meaning, through understanding, or will, or memory, especially of love.
