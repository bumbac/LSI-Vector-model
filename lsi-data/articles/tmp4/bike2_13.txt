Title: Fox Makes Big Changes to Its Forks and Shocks, Including a Whole New Model

Text: Fox’s 2021 line features an all new fork with 38mm chassis that slots between the 36 and the dual-crown 40. All forks feature a new rounded arch, bleeder valves, and other updates. EVOL air springs are revised, as is the GRIP 2 damper. All new Float X2 and DHX2 shocks. Fox has a new fork, and major updates to its popular 36 trail fork, dual-crown 40, and X3 and DHX rear shocks. Our samples only just arrived, so the information is based on our initial impressions and garage inspection—we’ll offer a review after a few more rides. Most models should be available in stores this week. New Fork Technologies Fox’s 40 and 36 get all new chassis, features, and tech for 2021. Then there’s the new model, the 38, which fits between the two. Here’s what’s new-new. New arch courtesy Rounded Arch This is the most visible change to the forks. The new design sits further forward than on older forks, increasing available space between the arch and the headtube when the fork is at bottom out. It’s also rounded instead of squared, with the new shape providing a better stiffness-to-weight ratio, according to Fox. Bleeder valves courtesy Bleeder Valves The second thing you’ll notice about the new Fox forks are the nubbins jutting out from the back of the lowers. These are bleeder valves—press them and you’ll equalize the pressure inside the lower leg with the pressure outside. Why? The air volume inside a fork’s lower legs is effectively an air spring. Changes in weather, temperature, and altitude can cause a pressure differential between the air in the fork’s lowers and outside air pressure. If there’s a large enough difference, the fork’s air spring curve can change dramatically, altering the performance and, potentially, shortening its travel. According to Fox’s global brand manager, Sean Estes, you should use the bleeders “all the time,” but especially if you’re doing a ride or shuttle with large elevation changes. courtesy Lower Leg Channels Another new feature is inside a new ridge that runs from the wiper seal to about the mid-point of the lowers. This ridge is formed by a channel inside the lowers that serves a couple of purposes. It increases the available air volume inside the lowers, which limits how much air pressure in the lowers increases as the fork compresses—a condition that can alter the fork’s overall spring curve and limit travel. This benefit is tied into the bleeder valves describe above. Another benefit, says Fox, is that the channels allow the oil baths contained in the fork’s lower legs to constantly circulate to the top of the lowers, keeping all the important bits well-lubricated. Updated EVOL Air Spring Rounding out a trilogy of spring updates, the 2021 EVOL air spring has more negative-air volume compared to the 2020 EVOL air spring. According to Estes, “The benefit for the user is improved sensitivity near top out and improved mid-stroke support.” New tech for GRIP 2 courtesy Updated GRIP 2 Damper For 2021, Fox added its VVC (Variable Valve Control) system to the compression side of the circuit (it was already present on the rebound side of GRIP 2’s damper). This external adjustment offers the kind of shim-stack tuning that usually requires tearing a damper apart, or so Fox claims. Fox’s GRIP 2 explainer video below describes VVC’s function on the rebound side (starting about 1:25)—the design and function of VVC is the same on the compression side.

Floating axle courtesy Quick-Release Floating Axle This feature is designed to keep the fork legs aligned at all points in the travel, reducing binding and friction. A sliding sleeve on the drive side dropout compensates for front hub tolerance drift so the fork legs are always perfectly square instead of pinched in (if the hub’s too short) or bowed out (too wide). You set the sliding sleeve’s position and axle clamping force once, then the system works like the Fox’s well-known QR axle. You can remove and install the wheel as much as you want without fiddling with the sleeve. You’ll only need to reset the sleeve if you get a new wheel. If you want to save a few grams and run a bolt-on axle, you’ll need to reset the floating sleeve’s position every time you install the wheel. The process is fairly straightforward: Open the sleeve’s pinch bolt, install the front wheel, properly torque the axle, cycle the fork a few times, then torque the sleeve’s pinch bolt. Is doing that every time you install the wheel worth a few grams savings for a lighter bolt-on axle? Not to me, but it’s up to you. The Forks The Fox 38 in limited edition color courtesy Fox 38 Price $949 to $1,199 Wheel size 27.5 and 29 Offset 37, 44, 51mm Travel 160 to 180mm Axle 15x110mm, QR or bolt on Weight starting at 2,180g As its name clearly implies, this all new single-crown fork has 38mm stanchions. Fox makes the fork in 160 to 180mm travel options for riders who want a more robust fork than Fox’s 36. The 38 is “31-percent stiffer transverse shear, 17-percent stiffer fore/aft and 38-percent torsionally stiffer than 36,” says Fox. Not surprisingly, it’s heavier than the 36. Comparing claimed weights of both forks in their lightest build (27.5”, FIT4 damper), a 38 weighs about 215 grams more than a 36 (2,180g VS 1,965g). Other than chassis diameter, the 38 has one other crucial difference from the 36: the inside of the steerer is elliptical in the steerer’s taper zone (the exterior remains round). This puts more material fore/aft for greater stiffness in this plane but relieves material side to side to save weight. Because of the larger legs, the 38’s air spring is slightly different than the 36. Instead of using the fork’s leg as the spring chamber, the 38 has an air cartridge inside the leg and runs a smaller diameter air piston. Fox did this to create a spring curve Fox’s engineers desired—there would be too much air volume if the leg was used as the air chamber—but it does mean riders will use higher air pressures in the 38 than in the 36. The 2021 Fox 36 in limited edition color courtesy Fox 36 Price $849 to $1,099 Wheel size 27.5 and 29 Offset 37, 44, 51mm Travel 150 to 160mm Axle 15x110mm, QR or bolt on Weight starting at 1,965g Though it isn’t an all new fork like the 38, the 2021 36 was completely overhauled. According to Estes, the only carryover parts are the air-valve cap, and an o-ring. The new 36 gets the new arch, bleeder valves, lower leg channels, revised EVOL air spring, and revised GRIP 2 damper. The 2021 Fox 40 courtesy Fox 40 Price $1,749 Wheel size 27.5 and 29 Offset 48, 52, 56mm Travel 203mm Axle 20x110 bolt on Weight starting at 2,816g Like the 36, the new 40 gets the new arch, bleeder valves, lower leg channels, revised EVOL air spring, and revised GRIP 2 damper. There’s also a small naming change: in 2020, the 29er downhill fork was called the 49. For 2021, the fork is called 40 no matter the wheel size. 2021 New Shock Details The 2021 Float X2 courtesy Float X2  Price $639 to $669 Fox’s heavy-duty air shock also got completely redesigned. A host of changes make the damper do more work, so the spring can do what it does best. There’s a new main piston that offers more oil flow, and Fox’s VVC gets added to the high-speed rebound circuit. The latter change required the shock’s developers to move the external high-speed rebound adjuster to the lower eyelet. There’s also a new microcellular urethane bottom-out bumper that feels more progressive. That combo—of the updated damper and new bumper—means riders should need fewer air-volume reducers compared to a 2020 X2, says Estes. The climb-mode/firm-mode selector now has its own circuit—it used to be part of the low-speed compression circuit—which allowed Fox’s team to make the firm mode, when engaged, firmer. A new air seal reduces overall friction. The 2021 X2’s piggyback reservoir is shorter than the 2020 model, which should improve frame compatibility. When asked how the 2021 X2 feels compared to the 2020 X2, Estes said that, “The new Float X2 is smoother across the board, more progressive in the end stroke with better bottom out resistance, and more precisely tunable with VVC on the high speed rebound circuit.” The 2021 DHX2 shock courtesy DHX2 Price $619 to $649 (spring not included) The coil-sprung DHX2 gets the damper changes found in the Float X2, the new MCU bottom out bumper, and the shorter piggyback reservoir. One change specific to the DHX2 is a new steel outer body. “This allows for faster pressure responses to shaft motion leading to less hysteresis,” says Fox. Another update to the coil-spring sock is spring collar with detents that should keep it from working loose.
