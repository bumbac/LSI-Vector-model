Title: Why Runners Should Sign Up to Be Living Organ Donors

Text: When Subbu Venkat, 56, an engineering manager in Houston and a seasoned marathoner, learned in 2013 that a close family member needed an immediate kidney transplant due to an autoimmune condition, he wanted to do everything he could to support them. After doing some initial research and consulting with his relative’s medical team, he decided he was willing to make the ultimate act of humanity and compassion and became his relative’s living kidney donor in September 2014. Mary Rice-Boothe’s husband, Marki Boothe, was diagnosed with kidney failure in 2019, and she navigated hurdles within the healthcare system for over a year before he was able to receive a transplant. Rice-Boothe, 45, who is also a runner, wasn’t a match for Marki, but she participated in a living donor exchange to help her husband get a much-needed kidney. → You love running. We love running! Come join us at RW+ 🏃🏾‍♀️🏃🏻‍♂️ When going through the donation process, Venkat and Rice-Boothe learned that their optimal physical health as runners made them ideal candidates to be living organ donors. But not many active people are aware of this key detail, much less how to become a living organ donor and what the risks are for runners. We’ll break it down for you. Here’s everything runners need to know about living organ donation. Needed: Living Organ Donors Many people are familiar with the concept of deceased organ donation; the process can be easily started by checking a box that states you want to donate your organs when you die when you are applying for a new driver’s license. (You can also start the process here.) “Deceased organ donors have the potential to save up to seven lives with donatable organs alone, which include the heart, liver, lungs, pancreas, kidneys, and intestines, and that number goes up to 33 when also considering tissue donation,” said Cedric Sheffield, MD, Transplant Surgeon and Surgical Director of Heart Transplantation, Cleveland Clinic Weston Hospital in Weston, Florida. State laws can vary and family members may have to still consent to donate your organs, so it’s important to start that conversation, Dr. Sheffield added. However, there is still a much greater need for committed donors for the number of people on the waiting list for transplants. Right now, there are more than 100,000 registrations for organ donation, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), but in 2020 only 39,036 transplants occurred. It’s far less common to sign up to be a living organ donor. Typically, living people can only donate a kidney or part of their liver, according to Dr. Sheffield; kidney donation is the most common for living donors, because it carries a much lower risk to the donor than liver donation would. “Donation for kidneys is not only increasing and helping to decrease the shortage of organs, but we’ve also found that living donor kidneys, as opposed to cadaveric kidneys, have better outcomes,” Dr. Sheffield said. “The immediate short-term function of those living donor kidneys is better than cadaveric kidneys and the long-term outcomes are excellent.” The majority of living donors will sign up because they know someone close to them who needs an organ in the immediate future, like Venkat and Rice-Boothe. Many also end up donating through the concept of non-directed or altruistic donation. If someone with a loved one who needs a kidney isn’t a compatible match (determined by compatible blood types and other blood markers), they could end up participating in an exchange with another donor-recipient pair. Adding altruistic donors—donors without an existing connection to a recipient—to the mix only furthers a recipient’s chance of getting a transplant. “Living donors are highly screened with a full medical and psychosocial evaluation to ensure that they do not have medical conditions that will interfere with their health or their ability to be a donor, such as uncontrolled high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer and certain kinds of infections, as well as uncontrolled psychiatric conditions that can make it complicated for them to get through this process,” Dr. Sheffield said. “One of the goals is to make sure that their donation decision is completely voluntary and free of pressure or free of guilt.” Why are athletes prime candidates for organ donation? Athletes and active people are ideal candidates for organ donation, whether living or deceased, because fit people tend to be in general good health from a cardiovascular standpoint, making their organs more likely to be a healthy match for a recipient, according to Latifa Sage Silski, MD, an assistant professor and transplant surgeon at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in Cincinnati, Ohio. Additionally, active people increase their own chances of a healthy recovery from their own surgery as a living donor. “You’re more likely to become or qualify to be a living kidney donor if you are an athlete or runner because you're more likely to be healthy enough to be good enough to get through the evaluation to be a donor,” Dr. Silski said. “For a liver, it’s a little bit tricky and comes with slightly higher risk because you’re giving a segment or portion of your liver, and because it also has to do with your anatomy, the size of your body compared to the size of your recipient.” An added bonus that may inspire athletes to become living donors: By donating an organ, you are giving recipients of that life-saving transplant not just an improvement in their overall quality of life, but also the ability to return to previous or new levels of fitness and activity, Dr. Sheffield said. A common concern among potential donors is the fear that they or a family member may need a kidney in the future when they would now only have one of their own. However, Dr. Silski noted that you will be prioritized on transplant waitlists if you need one yourself, and if you’ve donated altruistically, you can receive vouchers through the National Kidney Registry to move a family member in need ahead of the line as well. “My recipient and I were both initially concerned about any risk it could create for me, and once we learned more and began to understand the level of risk and benefit, we were eager to move forward,” Venkat said. Subbu Venkat Are there any lingering effects of donating a kidney? The biggest thing to be mindful of after donating a kidney is avoiding severe dehydration, according to Dr. Silski, which puts you at risk for acute renal injury and can result in hospitalization.  “A two-kidney person has some buffer for tolerating the dehydration, but with one kidney, your ability to compensate for the dehydration decreases,” she said. “I usually tell living donors that they actually have to do the things that we all should be doing [i.e. drinking to thirst to allow your body to maintain and work toward equilibrium] and the amount of fluid one needs does not necessarily change.” According to Dr. Silski, one thing runners and athletes should consider before becoming a kidney donor is their use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen, because they will have to limit or eliminate their use of them post-organ donation. This is because they can increase your risk of kidney damage or failure, especially when dehydration comes into play (which runners, in general, are also at higher risk for). Dr. Silski recommends these alternatives for pain management if you have donated an organ: Acetaminophen Aspirin Epsom salt or ice baths Massage (remember to hydrate after!) “But in exchange for that short-term pain, you are able to double somebody’s life expectancy, especially if they’re already on dialysis,” Dr. Silski said. Donors will also want to keep the fact that they’ll need time off from work to recover in mind as well. Both Venkat and Rice-Boothe ended up taking two to three weeks off post-surgery. Will donating an organ impact running progress? Having surgery to donate a kidney will require some time off from intense activity such as running, but it will likely end up being shorter than most runners would expect. The living donor surgery is typically performed laparoscopically, using small incisions and a camera. “We typically don’t cut through the muscle for kidney donor operations, so because there is no change to muscle mass, most people shouldn’t have a problem returning to their previous level of activity,” Dr. Silski said. “The only real risk would be in the immediate post-op weeks, because of abdominal pressure and an increased risk for a hernia.” Venkat was cleared to run a month post-op; he started with a three-mile run and built up to a 10-mile long run in two weeks later. At about three-and-a-half months post-op, he ran the Houston Half Marathon in January 2015, followed by the Boston Marathon that April. “I was admittedly a bit nervous about doing that first post-op marathon, because my doctor had told me to be on guard and stop if anything hurt,” Venkat said. “It’s also especially important to be mindful about dehydration when you only have one kidney, and living and training in a hot and humid climate like Houston’s creates an additional challenge there.” This content is imported from {embed-name}.

Venkat has continued to participate in races all over the country and even the world since his donation. He set his current marathon PR of 3:10:30 at the 2018 Grandma’s Marathon, at nearly four years post-donation. His future goals include beating that time and running all the World Marathon Majors (he just has London and Tokyo left to go). Rice-Boothe also took a month off after her surgery before she began doing walk-run intervals for up to 30 minutes. She worked her way up to completing a virtual half marathon in December 2020. She had completed her first marathon virtually in 2019 to receive guaranteed entry to the 2020 New York City Marathon, which ended up being canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic (and which she would have had to miss anyway due to the timing of her surgery and her subsequent recovery). She was also supposed to run the 2021 Houston Marathon if it had been held as a live event, so she has hopes to run both of those races in the future as her first in-person marathon. “Fitness-wise, I don’t feel any different from how I felt before my surgery,” she said. “I was running 30 to 35 miles per week before the surgery, and I’m back to that now.” Zora Boothe Why is being an organ donor important? As mentioned earlier, there is a surplus of people who would benefit from an organ transplant, and a significant shortage of organs. Organ shortages and transplant waitlists also highlight racial disparities and inequities in healthcare. According to the National Kidney Foundation, 33%, or 1 in 3 people, are at risk of kidney disease, with minority populations having an even higher risk. Black or African Americans are almost four times more likely and Hispanics or Latinos are 1.3 times more likely to have kidney failure compared to white Americans. Those of Asian American, American Indian, or Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander heritage are at an increased risk as well. These groups have higher rates of high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and heart disease, which all contribute to an increased risk of kidney disease. “With African Americans making up the largest group of minorities in need of organ transplantation, 28.7% of the total candidates waiting for transplants are African Americans,” Dr. Sheffield said. “There is an unmet need for minority organ donation [as this increases a minority candidate’s chances of having a match], as there can be religious or cultural or historical distrust of the healthcare system within the community. Future progress requires that those barriers be broken down, and there’s a fear of the unknown, fear of abandonment, fear of racism.” Rice-Boothe—who works as a chief equity officer for The Leadership Academy, an organization that partners with school systems and organizations across the country in implementing their efforts in becoming equitable systems—noted that pursuing living kidney donation is one tangible way people can contribute to ongoing social justice efforts, as access to healthcare often plays a role in these disparities. Although Rice-Boothe and her husband are both Black, she noted that she wasn’t fully aware of the racial disparities in this area of healthcare until she and Marki went in for their surgeries. “It was all Black and brown faces that I saw in [the transplant hospital], and they weren’t all 70 and 80 years old either, so it definitely hit me the most then,” she said. “There are existing issues of mistrust, but the danger of actually being the donor is so minimal, especially if you are connected to a hospital and a system that does this on a daily basis. And when it’s an issue that is disproportionately hurting your people, I believe this is a small sacrifice to make to be able to help your people.” How to pursue organ donation If you have a recipient in need of a kidney or liver donation, the easiest way to pursue becoming a donor is typically through the recipient’s medical team. The recipients’ insurance typically covers all of the donor’s costs, as well, including screening tests and any necessary travel. If you’re interested in being an altruistic donor, you can typically call a hospital transplant center or look into organizations such as UNOS and the National Kidney Registry, which offer information about transplantation, transplant and donor processes, as well as sign-up options, on their websites. Kidney Donor Athletes also provides information on resources, as well as stories from athletes who are living kidney donors.
