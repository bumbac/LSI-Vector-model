Title: Thai Chicken Skewers with Peanut Sauce

Text: rvanp | 08/02/2020 This was so so good! I followed the marinade recipe at 1.5 volume as I had more chicken... when I mixed it with my thighs cut for skewers, it seemed still a bit low on quantity so I added maybe an 1/8th to 1/4 cup of Ponzu Sauce I had in the fridge as it has a lime component to it. I also added about 2 tsp of Sambal, combined it and let it marinate all day in the fridge. It was fantastic, the flavours of the marinade really come through penetrating the chicken well. I also made the peanut sauce as per recipe but be sure not to leave it too long and or too hot or it could separate. Again I added a bit of Sambal as we like some heat. I read online that if your peanut sauce separates you can add a bit of water to bring it back together so instead of water... I added just a bit of that same Ponzu Sauce and it worked fabulously. I didn't want to water it down, hence trying Ponzu instead as it's a pretty thin flavourful sauce. I guess I got lucky, so delicious! This is really an easy fast recipe to pull together!
