Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times BRUSSELS ‚Äî The European Union has filed a lawsuit in Belgium against the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca over what it says is a breach of contract in the company‚Äôs delivery of Covid-19 vaccine, the European Commission announced on Monday. The bloc‚Äôs relationship with the company has soured rapidly since AstraZeneca said in January that it would not be able to deliver on its scheduled vaccine doses for the first quarter of the year, setting the region‚Äôs vaccination campaign back by weeks. ‚ÄúThe commission has started last Friday a legal action against the company AstraZeneca on the basis of breaches of the advanced purchase agreement,‚Äù said Stefan de Keersmaecker, a spokesman on health issues for the commission, the E.U.‚Äôs executive branch. ‚ÄúThe reason indeed being that the terms of the contract, or some terms of the contract, have not been respected and the company has not been in a position to come up with a reliable strategy to ensure the timely delivery of doses.‚Äù Mr. de Keersmaecker said that all 27 E.U. member countries supported the move. The company, while acknowledging that production problems have caused delays, has said its failure to deliver is not a breach of contract, because the European Union had placed its order after other clients, most notably Britain. A spokesman for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. The two parties had been engaged in a dispute arbitration effort, but the European Union decided to move ahead with a legal case. The contract is under Belgian law, and legal proceedings would happen in Belgium. Our priority is to ensure #COVID19 vaccine deliveries take place to protect the health of üá™üá∫.  This is why @EU_Commission has decided jointly with all Member States to bring legal proceedings against #AstraZeneca.  Every vaccine dose counts. Every vaccine dose saves lives. ‚Äî Stella Kyriakides (@SKyriakidesEU) April 26, 2021 The European Union‚Äôs vaccine contract with AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish company, was the first it signed, in August last year, and covers 400 million doses. So far, the company has delivered just over 30 million. In an interview with The Times on Sunday, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the company had only supplied a quarter of what it had promised to the bloc, and had to deliver 200 million doses of vaccines by the end of this quarter. She indicated that the European Union would not open talks over future supply. ‚ÄúAt the moment, the company has a delay in delivering 200 million doses of vaccine by the end of the second quarter,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe number speaks for itself.‚Äù Matina Stevis-Gridneff and Advertisement Continue reading the main story India continues to shatter case records as it awaits international aid.

Atul Loke for The New York Times India‚Äôs coronavirus crisis deepened on Monday with the number of new reported cases setting a global record for the fifth consecutive day, as countries, companies and members of the large diaspora pledged to send oxygen and other critical aid. India‚Äôs health ministry reported almost 353,000 new cases and 2,812 deaths on Monday, and enormous funeral pyres continued to burn in the worst-affected cities. Experts say that India‚Äôs reported overall toll of more than 195,000 deaths could be a vast undercount. In New Delhi, where Covid-19 patients have died after hospitals ran out of oxygen, the government extended a lockdown by another week. India‚Äôs Supreme Court last week ordered the government to come up with a ‚Äúnational plan‚Äù for distributing oxygen supplies. The problems in India‚Äôs hospitals go beyond oxygen shortages. In the western state of Gujarat, more than a dozen patients were evacuated from a hospital on Sunday night after an air-conditioning unit caught fire, the Press Trust of India reported, the third accident involving virus patients in India in the past seven days. Last Friday in another western state, Maharashtra, a hospital fire also caused by an air-conditioning unit killed 15 patients. Two days earlier, at least 22 patients died in a hospital in the city of Nashik, also in Maharashtra, after a leak cut off oxygen supplies. The Biden administration, under pressure to help with the Indian surge as patients and their families make desperate online pleas for aid, said on Sunday that it had partially lifted a ban on the export of raw materials for vaccines and would also supply India with therapeutics, test kits, ventilators and personal protective gear. Britain, France and Germany have also promised to send medical equipment to India, a key producer of vaccines for lower-income countries. ‚ÄúJust as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need,‚Äù President Biden said on Twitter on Sunday. Two Indian-American businessmen ‚Äî the Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, and the Google chief, Sundar Pichai ‚Äî have both said that their companies will provide financial assistance to India. ‚ÄúDevastated to see the worsening Covid crisis in India,‚Äù Mr. Pichai wrote on Twitter, pledging $18 million to aid groups working in the country.

Dmitry Kostyukov for The New York Times BRUSSELS ‚Äî American tourists who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 will be able to visit the European Union over the summer, the head of the bloc‚Äôs executive body said in an interview with The New York Times on Sunday, more than a year after shutting down nonessential travel from most countries to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The fast pace of vaccination in the United States, and advanced talks between the authorities there and the European Union over how to make vaccine certificates acceptable as proof of immunity for visitors, will enable the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, to recommend a switch in policy that could see trans-Atlantic leisure travel restored. ‚ÄúThe Americans, as far as I can see, use European Medicines Agency-approved vaccines,‚Äù Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said Sunday in an interview with The Times in Brussels. ‚ÄúThis will enable free movement and the travel to the European Union. ‚ÄúBecause one thing is clear: All 27 member states will accept, unconditionally, all those who are vaccinated with vaccines that are approved by E.M.A.,‚Äù she added. The agency, the bloc‚Äôs drugs regulator, has approved all three vaccines being used in the United States, namely the Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson shots. Ms. von der Leyen did not offer a timeline for when exactly tourist travel might open up or details on how it would occur. But her comments are a top-level statement that the current travel restrictions are set to change on the basis of vaccination certificates. Diplomats from Europe‚Äôs tourist destination countries, mostly led by Greece, have argued for weeks that the bloc‚Äôs criteria for determining whether a country is a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù origin purely based on low coronavirus cases are fast becoming irrelevant given the progress of vaccination campaigns in the United States, Britain and some other countries. With U.K. cases low, Scotland and Wales reopen restaurants and stores. A pub in Glasgow, Scotland on Monday. Credit... Andy Buchanan/Agence France-Presse ‚Äî Getty Images Scotland and Wales reopened restaurants, cafes, and nonessential shops on Monday, marking the next phase of a gradual relaxation of coronavirus restrictions that have been in place for months. In Scotland, restaurants can serve food but not alcohol indoors until 8 p.m., and they can serve food and alcohol outdoors without restrictions. Stores, beauty salons, museums and galleries also reopened, and people are permitted to book travel in the rest of Britain. The first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, said she was hopeful that the country would continue its progress and lift more restrictions by the summer. But she cautioned that the virus was more infectious now than it had been in earlier waves and, therefore, ‚ÄúWe must stick to the rules.‚Äù Free rapid tests will be available to the public. In Wales, places of worship and retail stores reopened, and restaurants resumed outdoor service. Outdoor wedding receptions with up to 30 people can take place. Cases remain low in Britain, with more than 40 percent of the population having received at least one dose of a vaccine. On Sunday, the country reported just over 1,700 new cases and 11 deaths, according to a New York Times database.

Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times The governments of Singapore and Hong Kong said on Monday that a long-delayed travel bubble between the two Asian financial centers would begin next month, allowing travelers on designated flights to bypass quarantine. The travel arrangement, which was originally supposed to begin last November, was suspended at the last minute when Hong Kong experienced a sudden surge in cases. With both places now reporting relatively few local infections, officials say the travel corridor will begin on May 26. ‚ÄúBoth sides will need to stay very vigilant in the next one month, so that we can launch the first flights smoothly,‚Äù Ong Ye Kung, Singapore‚Äôs minister of transport, said in a statement. The arrangement, which is open to people of any nationality in Singapore and Hong Kong, will begin with one flight per day in each direction for up to 200 passengers. Travelers to both places must test negative for the coronavirus before departure and again upon arrival. They are also required to download and use government contact-tracing apps. Travelers from Hong Kong must have received their second dose of a vaccine at least 14 days earlier, with some exceptions. Officials in Hong Kong, where the vaccination campaign has struggled to gain momentum, say they hope that this will give residents an incentive to get vaccinated. (There is no vaccination requirement for travelers from Singapore to Hong Kong.) Officials said that the bubble would be suspended automatically for two weeks if either city recorded a seven-day average of more than five local cases from an unknown source. The bubble is seen as an important step toward economic recovery in the two cities, both major travel hubs whose flagship carriers, Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines, only operate international flights. Similar travel bubbles are already in effect between Australia and New Zealand and between Palau and Taiwan, all places where local transmission of the coronavirus is almost nonexistent. A tourist haven in Thailand was poised to reopen, until a surge in virus cases. A small number of guests enjoying the pool at a resort in Phuket, Thailand, this month. Credit... Adam Dean for The New York Times Only a few weeks ago, Phuket seemed poised for a comeback. After a year of practically no foreign tourists arriving in Thailand, the national government decided that Phuket would start welcoming vaccinated visitors in July, without requiring them to go through quarantine. The project was called Phuket Sandbox. But Thailand is now gripped by its worst Covid-19 outbreak since the pandemic began, spread in part by the well-heeled Thais who partied in Phuket and Bangkok with no social distancing. The confirmed daily caseload ‚Äî albeit low by global standards ‚Äî has increased from 26 on April 1 to more than 2,000 three weeks later, in a country that in early December had about 4,000 cases total. The opening that Phuket had planned for July 1 now appears unlikely, Thailand‚Äôs tourism minister acknowledged this month. ‚ÄúIf you ask me how optimistic I am, I cannot say,‚Äù said Nanthasiri Ronnasiri, the director of the tourism authority‚Äôs Phuket office. ‚ÄúThe situation changes all the time.‚Äù The virus‚Äôs resurgence after so many months of economic hardship is devastating for the majority of Phuket‚Äôs residents, who depend on foreign tourists for their livelihoods.
