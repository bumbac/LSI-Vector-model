Title: 21 Best Face Moisturizers With SPF 2021

Text: Even if you're spending your days primarily inside, and the sun isn't out, your skin is still in need of SPF. Since sunscreen should be applied every day‚Äîyes, literally every day‚Äîwhy not consolidate steps by using a sunscreen/moisturizer hybrid? The hydrating formulas give you the benefits of sun protection without the white, streaky aftermath. Plus, it makes it that much easier to apply (aka no more excuses about forgetting to put on sunscreen), especially now that warmer weather is approaching, and we‚Äôre craving spending more time outdoors (hello, spring!). Look for moisturizing ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ceramides, or niacinamide that give your skin a drink without leaving it greasy. And if you're still in the camp of "my skin doesn't get burned," that's not an excuse to skip daily SPF. According to The Skin Cancer Foundation, "no matter your skin type, UV radiation from the sun and other sources can cause dangerous, lasting damage to your skin." Sunscreen isn't just about protecting your skin from a sunburn; it also reduces your risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma (the second most common type of skin cancer) by about 40 percent (again, according to The Skin Cancer Foundation) and lowers your melanoma risk by 50 percent. And if it's aging you're worried about, it has your skin covered there too as it prevents wrinkles, sagging, and age spots as well. Ghostly white cast turning you off? That‚Äôs because sunscreens (even in moisturizers) are usually ‚Äúwhite and thick by nature which makes them stand out‚Äîmainly in darker skin tones. This leaves behind the white cast, which is the greyish-purple ghosting effect caused by the sunscreen,‚Äù says Kemi Fabusiwa , MD, board-certified dermatologist. If you have a darker skin tone, choose chemical sunscreens, which don‚Äôt leave the white cast behind. ‚ÄúChemical sunscreens provide very high, broad-spectrum UV protection and do this in lesser concentrations, Dr. Fabusiwa notes. These SPFs are ‚Äúlighter and are formulated specifically so that they don‚Äôt leave behind a white cast.‚Äù And, if you still want to banish the white cast, say hello to tinted sunscreen! üôå (Keep reading for some favorites.) To get all these benefits of SPF, you have to make sure you're wearing it correctly: ‚ÄúJust remember, you need at least a nickel-size drop of sunscreen or SPF moisturizer to cover your face every morning," says Mona Gohara, MD, dermatologist and Women's Health advisory board member.
