Title: Britney Spears' attorney files petition to remove her father from overseeing her medical decisions

The request came in the form of a petition Samuel D. Ingham III filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Tuesday evening. Jamie Spears has been the conservator of both her person and estate since 2008.
