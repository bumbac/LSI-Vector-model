Title: The Best Gym Bags for Runners

Text: Remember packing your gym bag the night before work, or your weekender bag the day before a big race? Going down that mental checklist and making sure you didn‚Äôt forget your sports bra, your socks, your shorts, your running shoes or your water bottle was such a part of our regular routine that we could basically do it with our eyes closed. But it‚Äôs been a minute. And as studios and races start opening back up again, we want to make sure we show up fully prepared. Having a bag that‚Äôs conveniently designed to carry all of your essentials makes it that much easier to plan for your workout and that much easier to go the extra mile when you get to the gym, track, yoga studio, or wherever else your starting line might be. ‚Üí Find out What to Wear on your run with the Runner‚Äôs World generator üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Smarter Ways to Stash Your Stuff Don‚Äôt get us wrong‚Äîwe‚Äôre definitely not against throwing your stuff into whatever basic bag you‚Äôve got, but so many brilliant new designs are simply better suited for carting workout gear to and from the gym, with pockets that act like dry bags for sweaty clothes, separate compartments for dirty sneakers, straps that hold yoga mats perfectly in place, and more. Manufacturers are taking into consideration how bags are being used and how they can improve gym-goers‚Äô overall experience. Bags are lighter, cooler, more efficient and more comfortable to cart around, regardless of whether you‚Äôre walking, running, biking, driving, or flying to your next fitness destination. How We Chose There is no shortage of good bags out there. We looked for ones that we thought runners, in particular, would like, keeping in mind that there is no carry-on that is one size fits all. While some people won‚Äôt sport anything other than a backpack (we see you, ultrarunners), others love taking a tote bag to work or traveling everywhere with a duffel bag in tow. Each of these 12 styles is designed to meet your needs and carry your workout gear comfortably. And we promise they won‚Äôt stink up your routine. We hope they help make the transition from home gym to in-person training (and racing!) that much smoother.
