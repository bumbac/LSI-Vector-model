Title: How To Make Vegan In-N-Out-Style Burgers At Home

Text: Women's Health asked our readers what they miss most now that they’ve gone vegan, and so many professed their longing for a classic drive-thru-esque cheeseburger...In-N-Out's animal-style burger to be exact. Saucy, melty, and seriously meaty, it may be hard to think that any vegan recipe could take the place of an epic cheeseburger. Think again… thanks to vegan cheese and an Impossible Burger made from all plant-based ingredients, this sammie will have you forgetting all about the beef. To create a burger inspired by the California classic (sans meat and dairy), the WH test kitchen smothered the patties with OG yellow mustard and seared them for a crispy meat-like crust. Topped with sweet sautéed onions, a stellar special sauce, and a vegan cheese that actually melts (seriously!), this burger rivals any that you would get at a restaurant. So why not indulge in a little nostalgia with this easy, cheesy burger that’s perfect for your vegan diet? Drive-thru who? You can make this epic burger right at home.
