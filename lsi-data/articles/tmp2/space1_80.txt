Title: Apollo at 50: A Celebration Guide

Text: Apollo celebrations have already begun at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. The spacesuit worn by Apollo 11’s Neil Armstrong has been undergoing restoration and will be on view beginning July 16, along with dozens of Apollo artifacts. Apollo Lunar Module number 2 (LM-2), an unflown version of the two-stage vehicle that ferried astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface and back, is displayed in the Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall. Originally built without landing gear for a (later canceled) uncrewed test in Earth orbit, LM-2 has been modified for display purposes to look like the Apollo 11 Eagle. In June, Major League Baseball joins the Museum in a salute to moon landings with "Apollo at the Park." At 15 ballparks across the country, replica statues of Armstrong's spacesuit will greet baseball fans. The Museum’s Apollo 50 Festival runs from July 18 to July 20, and the Museum will stay open to the public until 2 a.m. on all three days, with special programming and activities.
