Title: TRD parts range brings more flair to all-new Toyota Supra

Text: Toyota’s in-house aftermarket parts division, Toyota Racing Development, has revealed a suite of accessories soon to be available for the all-new Supra. The parts are yet to be confirmed for global sale, however as details online suggest, they will almost certainly be seen in the local Japanese domestic market. Things kick off with an aggressive front splitter, which rather than clipping over the top of the existing bumper, instead replaces the black lower spoiler, with a more aggressive design and larger endplates. > Click here for all you need to know about the new Toyota Supra The side skirts also replace the standard black units, again with larger endplates, and above sits a new carbonfibre door garnish that augments one of the standard Supra’s more controversial design elements - the separated two-piece door skin. Around to the rear, the Supra’s standard diffuser section has been augmented with some enormous new endplates, complementing an aggressive lip spoiler. Finishing off the exterior look is a set of new 19-inch alloy wheels. TRD hasn’t announced any interior upgrades, but we’d imagine more details will eventually filter out of Japan over time. Toyota, like many Japanese manufacturers, offers a selection of factory sourced and approved performance parts due to the Japanese market’s penchant for modification. UK availability and pricing is yet to be announced, however details on the brand's Japanese site reveals that parts will range from 200,000 Yen (£1434) for the boot spoiler, up to 640,000 yen (£4590) for a full set of its new 19" forged aluminum wheels. The fifth generation Supra may have distinctly Germanic underpinnings, but it’s encouraging to see the Japanese tuning tradition alive and kicking in the 21st century.
