Title: GI Show – The Medium And Cyber Shadow Reviews, Guest Jacob Geller

Text: On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been playing recently, including The Medium, Cyber Shadow, Yakuza: Like A Dragon, Hitman 3, Resident Evil 3, and Overwatch. We're also joined by YouTuber Jacob Geller (@yacobg42) who talks about his work creating video essays. It's a full show, but we make time for another fantastic round of community emails in there somewhere. So please join Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), Blake Hester (@metallicaisrad), Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76), and myself for another wild and ever-entertaining episode! Thanks for listening!
