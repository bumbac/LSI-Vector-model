Text: On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we talk about some of the game's we played over the holiday break, including: Super Meat Boy Forever, Slay The Spire, and Airborne Kingdom. Then we run down the current release calendar for the year, and spend some time talking about the big, upcoming games we're excited to play, including: Resident Evil Village, Back 4 Blood, and Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart.
