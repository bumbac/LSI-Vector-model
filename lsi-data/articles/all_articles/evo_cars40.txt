Title: Alpina B4 S Edition 99 – special edition for Alpina’s M4 rival

Text: Alpina: a company you can rely on to offer something just a little more tasteful and a little more special than the BMWs it rebuilds to its own specification. A little more exclusive too, particularly with special-edition models like the new B4 S Biturbo Edition 99. As the name might suggest, Alpina will produce just 99 examples of the Edition 99, for little other reason it seems than to celebrate its continued existence and to offer customers just a few extra colours and options than they might otherwise have available with the standard B4 S Biturbo. > Click here for our review of the Alpina B4 Grigio Medio and Fire Orange are the two new shades, the latter a nod to Alpina’s early racing cars. Customers can take this a step further if they opt for a Heritage Design package, which colours the top half of the car in an Anthracite wrap and adds a set of 20-inch grey multi-spoke alloy wheels. The classic Alpina blue, as well as Sapphire Black and Mineral White are also available, the other visual element being the option of Alpina’s ‘deco-set’ in either matte blue or matte black. Meanwhile 20-inch forged alloy wheels are standard, wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tyres.
