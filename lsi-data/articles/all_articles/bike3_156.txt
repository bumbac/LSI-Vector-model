Title: 2015 Iditabike

Text: “Fat bikes versus dogs” isn’t exactly the grudge match of the century, nor a legendary, time-honored rivalry. But when an Anchorage fat biker destroyed the standing Iditarod record for both cyclists and dogs this week, it became a rare, triumphant tale of man-powered machine prevailing over husky-powered sled. Thirty-six-year-old John Lackey was reportedly shocked on Tuesday to finish this year’s 350-mile Iditarod Trail Invitational race in 1 day, 18 hours, and 32 minutes—a time that took 10 hours and 11 minutes off the previous cycling record, which was just set last year. Even more impressively, he came in 8 hours under the course record set by Iditarod sled dogs along the same course, which threads through the Alaska Range from Cook Inlet to McGrath in the Interior.

That was faster than I imagined. I didn't think it was going to be under two days.'' A veteran of the race, Lackey credits his record to the weather and lack of snow, which created perfect trail conditions for a fat bike this year but trying conditions for the sled dog race. Due to ice and tailwinds, Lackey said he hit speeds of up to 20mph, and at times, the course was almost too fast. That’s probably not a complaint shared by those sled dogs. Then again, their race comes with a first-place purse of $70,000. There’s no prize money offered for the cyclists—just the opportunity to shred hard on fat bikes and crush long-standing records on an iconic trail.
