Title: The 50 Best Albums of 2007

Text: In the six years since the release of their last proper full-length, Go Forth, many of Les Savy Fav’s stylistic tics have emerged as full-on musical fads. The band could have easily cast itself as unsung trendsetters with Let’s Stay Friends, but instead they chose to downplay their best-documented strengths, sanding their angular edges and streamlining their dance-punk grooves. The result is a solid, multifaceted, and stubbornly gimmick-free indie rock record. Tim Harrington’s lyrics are still sly and clever, and his delivery still tightly wound and frantic, but Let’s Stay Friends finds him coming into his own as a more versatile-- and occasionally downright tuneful-- singer. The rest of the band follows suit, branching out into new expressive territory without sacrificing its well-honed energy. For a group as explosive as Les Savy Fav, the understatement of Let’s Stay Friends may be the ballsiest thing they could have done. –Matt LeMay Listen: Les Savy Fav: “Raging in the Plague Age”
