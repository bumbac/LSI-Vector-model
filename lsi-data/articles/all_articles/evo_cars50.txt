Title: New Alpina D3 Bi-Turbo launched

Text: Alpina has launched the new 173mph D3 Bi-Turbo, which the company is calling the ‘World’s fastest diesel production car’. The new 3 Series-based model features a tweaked version of the twin-turbo straight-six diesel engine – tuned to produce 345bhp and 516lb ft of torque. The BiTurbo boasts a 0-62mph tome of 4.6 seconds, but also retains respectable official fuel economy of 53.2 mpg and CO2 emissions of just 139g/km. Although Alpina has produced some mightily fast performance cars in the past, the company has always been associated with making comfortable and nicely-finished Autobahn cruisers like the B3, and more recently turning onto the ever-popuar SUV sector with the similarly powerful XD3. Alpina says the new model is the result of two-years of development, with changes spread throughout the engine, gearbox, cooling system, body structure, wheels, tyres, aerodynamics, suspension and interior. There are some minor aerodynamic tweaks, and new quad-exit exhaust system with an intelligent acoustic valve. A set of the classic Alpina multi-spoke 19-inch alloy wheels and Alpina plaque complete the package. UK prices start at £46,950 for the saloon, rising to £49,950 for the Touring. The basic models come with the eight-speed automatic gearbox, Adaptive M Sport Suspension and all the usual Alpina creature comforts, but can also be specced with any BMW option.
