Title: Suspension Training for Abs

Text: When you‚Äôre out riding, you‚Äôre battling gravity, your bodyweight, and wind. So to be more stable on the bike, you want to get a little unstable when you train. A great way to do this is with a TRX or other suspension trainer. So, Dane Miklaus, C.S.C.S., founder of WORK Training Studio, created this TRX abs workout to help build a strong core and boost your endurance. ‚ÄúWhen using a suspension trainer like a TRX, the mechanisms of force that you‚Äôre battling, gravity and body weight, are the same as on a bike,‚Äù explains Miklaus. GO Suspension Trainer System TRX amazon.com $129.95 Buy Now During most traditional resistance exercises when you‚Äôre standing, sitting, lying, or using equipment, much of the stability is taken out of the picture‚Äîmeaning your core doesn‚Äôt work as hard. When using a suspension trainer, every single exercise requires your core to be the primary mechanism of stability, says Mikalus. And in a lot of moves, those lower leg stabilizing and deep hip muscles are working as well. So the functional training moves done with a TRX directly benefit the muscles you need to be a stronger, faster cyclist.
