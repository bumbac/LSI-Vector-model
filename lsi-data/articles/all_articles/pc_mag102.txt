Title: Master the Most Popular CRM Platforms With a $25 Boot Camp

Text: Most modern businesses are either already using a customer relationship management (CRM) solution or are about to. So what do they do? The better question is what don't they do. CRM is a very broad term, but it fits. A good CRM system doesn't just automate all the data-crunching that it used to take entire departments to accomplish, it makes that data immediately available to customers and the employees who support them. They are an essential tool, but as there are several systems in common use, it can be difficult to know which is the right one to use. That's what makes The Ultimate Oracle, SAP & Salesforce Training Prep Bundle invaluable for anyone entering the job market for sales, marketing, or even IT. It's a way to learn the top three CRM platforms quickly, so you're prepared to hit the ground running. Not only will these six courses teach you how to use the most popular CRM services, but you'll also be able to create your own by setting up a database and retrieval system through Oracle using SQL, or programming the same in SAP using the ABAP language. Even if you're new to coding, you'll get a great introduction to the basic concepts in a way that helps you understand the functions of a good CRM from the ground up. Of course, there's plenty of tutorial time devoted to America's most popular and highly rated CRM. The Salesforce "Trailhead" course is designed to take new users from beginners through to certified administrators in just a few days. Before you know it, you'll be designing custom apps in SF and taking the reins behind any sales or marketing team.
