Title: GI Show â€“ Monster Hunter: Rise And Disco Elysium: The Final Cut Reviews

Text: On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been digging recently, including Monster Hunter Rise, Disco Elysium: The Final Cut, Yakuza Kiwami, Evil Genius 2: World Domination, and Prey. Unfortunately, this is Joe Juba's last episode as a full time employee, so we spend some time saying a fond farewell and wishing him the best. It's a full show, but we make time for another fantastic round of community emails. So please join Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76), Joe Juba (@Joejuba), Jason Guisao (@Jason_Guisao), and Ben Reeves (@Benjaminreeves) for another wild and ever-entertaining episode! Thanks for listening!
