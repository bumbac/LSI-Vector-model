Title: Fully-Functioning E-Bike Uses Bitcoin to Unlock Its Electricity

Text: Bikes and technology. It’s been a match made in heaven for a while now: E-bike sales have surged, ride sharing services are exploring bikes in their fleets, and citywide bike shares are expanding and going dockless.  So it was only a matter of time before the world of blockchain and bitcoin entered the fray. And it did, back in June, when U.K. retailer 50cycles introduced Toba, a line of e-bikes that mine cryptocurrency while in motion. The bikes generate “LoyalCoin,” a proprietary cryptocurrency that mimics the points earned in a traditional rewards program. [Want to fly up hills? Climb! gives you the workouts and mental strategies to conquer your nearest peak.] But Toba didn’t tackle the most obvious opportunity for merging cycling and crypto: employing blockchain technology to use the bike, through either access to the juice for an undocked e-bike or physically unlocking a docked one. Enter Matthias Steinig. Motivated by nothing more than his own curiosity, the 49-year-old German has created a fully-functioning e-bike that requires a bitcoin payment to access its electricity.

Tomorrow i take a video how it works, so stay tuned! pic.twitter.com/X1z5tj2v72 — Matthias Steinig ⚡🟩 (@leblitzdick) October 10, 2018 The technical details of how Steinig built the bike, which he explains in full on his GitHub page , get complicated very quickly. “At this stage of the project, I would recommend only experienced computer users try it,” Steinig, who works as a system administrator in Berlin, told Bicycling. “But I don’t want to scare anyone. The project is also intended to be an inspiration for others to develop their own things and maybe use my project as a basis.” Courtesy of Matthias Steinig The one key aspect to note is Steinig’s use of something called the Lightning Network —the reason behind the bike’s unofficial name, the Lightning-Bike. Though cryptocurrencies enjoy major advantages over traditional currencies—the network’s inherent untraceability and decentralization, for example—speed has always been an issue. Transaction fees are expensive and confirmation processes take forever, according to financial news site FX Empire , and those drawbacks have severely inhibited bitcoin’s scalability. With the Lightning Network, transactions using bitcoin become, well, lightning fast. Using a QR code on the Lightning-Bike’s small screen, a user links to the bike and pays by phone through the Lightning Network. Steinig has set the rate, and depending on how much a user pays, they’ll gain access to a certain number of minutes with aid of the bike’s battery. This content is imported from YouTube.

Though the Lightning-Bike is still only a proof of concept experiment, Steinig hopes it’s the first step toward something that could reach the general public.

They are, in my opinion, technical milestones that are equal in their potential to the invention of the Internet,” Steinig said. “We’re still in the beginning, but this [makes it] possible to put your idea into practice, and let your creativity run free.” Jacob Meschke Contributing Writer Jacob joined Runner’s World and Bicycling as an editorial fellow after graduating from Northwestern University in 2018, where he studied journalism.
