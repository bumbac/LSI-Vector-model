Title: Apple's New Siri Remote Doesn't Support Motion Controls

Text: (Photo: Apple) This week Apple revealed a brand-new Apple TV 4K, which looks a lot like the old model with one exception: the remote. Its redesign adds a number of new features, but it's also lost a couple of key components. As reported by Digital Trends, Apple removed the accelerometer and the gyroscope from the new remote. In so doing, it can no longer act as a motion controller for games played through your Apple TV. This looks like a major oversight on Apple's part considering it wants Apple TV owners playing games through Apple Arcade. The iPhone and iPad still support motion controls. So what happens if you attempt to play a game requiring motion controls using the new remote? MacRumors took a look at the tvOS 14.5 code and discovered Apple has included a message that appears when this situation happens. It reads, "To play this game on your Apple TV, you need to connect the Apple TV Remote (1st generation) or a compatible PlayStation, Xbox or MFi controller." If you intend to play games through an Apple TV, then a game controller was probably on your purchase list, too. If it wasn't, it needs to be now. Apple will have the data showing how many people actually used the old remote as a motion controller and the figure is probably tiny so it decided to kill the feature and save a bit on manufacturing costs. It's still something to keep in if you are considering an upgrade, though.
