Title: Take Control of Your Sleep Cycle With 60% Off This App

Text: Exercise is great. A good, consistent diet can work wonders for your sense of well-being and long-term health, but a good night's sleep also has a big impact on your body and mind. Ironically, that solid eight hours of rest is the hardest thing for many of us to accomplish, and even on nights when our bodies are exhausted, our brain can refuse to cooperate, keeping us up for hours. There are numerous tricks you can use to help your brain shut down for the day, but many are little more than home remedies which don't work for everyone. If you want help from a sleep app, there's none better than Restly, which uses a science-based approach designed for long-term results. Right away, even the most wired user will find plenty to love about Restly. Choose from tons of soothing male or female voices, guiding you into dreamland with meditations and bedtime talks. If that's not to your liking, browse a library of white noise types and sounds from pastoral areas like lakes and streams, or soothing music; you can even combine the two. It's all about finding the sound cues that help each individual sleeper, and there's also guided meditation designed specifically for children. The benefits go beyond getting to bed in the moment, though. Restly can track your progress as you start to reach your ideal sleep goals, then set alarms and reminders to help you stay on that cycle. Even the interface is designed to be soothing from the moment you click on it, a fact that's earned it a nod as the top "Product of the Day" on Product Hunt. PCMag readers can start their quest for better sleep tonight with a lifetime subscription to the Restly Sleep App, available now for $39.99â€”60% off the $100 MSRP. Prices are subject to change.
