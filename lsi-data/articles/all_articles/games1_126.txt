Title: Call Of Duty: Warzone New Map Reveal After Verdansk Destroyed - GI Live

Text: Yesterday, Verdansk was blown away – quite literally. During the debut of Call of Duty: Warzone's Season 3 event, a nuclear missile struck the map, ostensibly devastating everything in the process. Soon after, players were transported to Rebirth Island, Warzone's smaller secondary map, 15 minutes after the explosion, where a giant mushroom cloud could be seen in the distance. Now, it's time to figure out what's next. Join myself and Alex Stadnik as we dive back into Warzone on the latest episode of GI Live. We're finally getting a look at the game's new map, and you can be right there with us as we drop in and go boots on the ground. As always, you can expect many, many wins today on GI Live – from the other teams, who will most certainly beat us. We'll be going live today around 1:50 pm CT (2:50 pm ET/11:50 am PT), about ten minutes before the map is supposed to debut.
