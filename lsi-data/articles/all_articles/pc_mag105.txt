Title: Take 50% Off This Streamlined Mac Dock Replacement

Text: Apple knows what Mac users like in terms of hardware, but not everyone is a fan of macOS, and in particular the Mac dock. You live with it because the hardware is worth it, but did you know replacing it is also an option? Brawer Software offers one such replacement in the form of uBar 4. It's an intuitive alternative to the dock and is quickly gaining traction among high-profile engineers at tech firms like Google and Facebook. One big annoyance for many dock users is its size. The dock is pretty bulky to begin with and can quickly become more bloated—especially if you're saving a bunch of favorites or doing a lot of multitasking. By comparison, the uBar is slim and streamlined. It allows you to squeeze in a lot more apps and offers the option of viewing them by name, icon, or both. Roll over, and the icon expands. There's also a rich set of customization options, such as locking the toolbar onto any side of the screen, vertically or horizontally. If you need even more space, simply expand the bar to add up to five rows, with clear differentiation between hidden and viewable apps. Are unresponsive apps or background processes slowing down your Mac? uBar makes it easy to spot which ones are and shutting them down is as easy as pressing the Shift key. Want to give it a try for your own Mac? PCMag readers can get lifetime access to uBar 4 Toolbar for Mac for $15—50% off the $30 MSRP. Prices are subject to change.
