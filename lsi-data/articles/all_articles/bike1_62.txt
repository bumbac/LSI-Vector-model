Title: Summer 2020 Print Issue Out Now

Text: Home has meant so much more than ever before in 2020. It’s been our offices, our kids’ schools and the starting and ending point of rides we would have otherwise eschewed for gnarlier or farther-flung or more picturesque trails. And it’s the underlying theme that runs throughout our Summer issue, which is on newsstands today.

And inside, we highlight the rise of backyard trails well beyond Marin, as suddenly time, space and a desire to dig align to create opportunity in places like Squamish and northern B.C. We also go to Asheville, North Carolina, where writer Graham Averill discovers the homegrown goodness of his local trails, now fully out of the shadow of the world-class singletrack in nearby Pisgah due to pandemic-related shutdowns. And we address two of the biggest issues plaguing our home country today—climate change and racial inequality—as they relate to mountain biking.

Ridgeline envy is real.

In his piece, Haggar relives the experience he and his building partner, Scott Veach, navigated as they plotted Dark Crystal from concept to creation to premature discovery to shutdown to legitimacy, a rollercoaster that lasted several years.
