Title: GI Show â€“ Hitman 3 And The Best Games To Play With Friends

Text: On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we continue our wrap up of the year. Instead of talking about all the games we've been playing recently, we look back and talk about some of our favorite multiplayer games from 2020, such as: Phasmophobia, Call of Duty: Warzone, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Among Us, Sackboy: A Big Adventure, Apex Legends, Sea of Thieves, Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout, Back 4 Blood, Wasteland 3, Overwatch, Moving Out, Destiny 2: Beyond Light, Jackbox Party Pack 7. Next we talk about Game Informer's newest cover game: Hitman 3. Developer IO Interactive shared with us what it has planned for the conclusion of its Hitman World of Assassination trilogy. Finally, we close out the show with another fantastic round of community emails.
