Title: The 50 Best Albums of 2014

Text: Lots of indie bands have mined the giddiness and sexual empowerment of the disco era, but few have tapped into the cultural fracture that followed it. The language of identity crisis is all over Mr Twin Sister’s second album, right down to the fact that they added a "Mr" to their name for this self-released sophomore effort (and then named the album after their newly christened selves). Mr Twin Sister is slicker, sexier, a little more concerned with mortality (the band endured a serious van accident in 2013), and the quintet’s lyrics often chase several possible threads: On "Out of the Dark", singer Andrea Estella declares that "I am a woman, but inside I’m a man, and I want to be as gay as I can!" A minute later, she looks back and wonders: "What ever happened to poor, dear me?” Mr Twin Sister are also adept at following the trickle-down of commonalities between house, electro, and new wave (especially on "Rude Boy", which suggests a shared lineage with Tom Tom Club’s "Genius of Love"). And like any honest survey of nightlife music, Mr Twin Sister's high highs ("In The House of Yes", "Twelve Angels") are followed quickly by low lows ("Blush", "Crime Scene")—the two sides of the same airy fantasy. —Abby Garnett
