Title: New Maserati Quattroporte spied testing ahead of launch

Text: To bridge the gap between today’s models and the all-new line-up now expected from 2022, Maserati is giving all current cars a facelift. Seen testing here in Germany ahead of its launch later this year, the Quattroporte is due to receive mild exterior, cabin and powertrain tweaks, to bring it up to speed with its rivals. Expected to come alongside the updated Levante SUV and Ghibli mid-sized saloon, the facelifted Quattroporte will compete with the likes of Jaguar’s XJ and the BMW 7-series, before the model’s given a complete overhaul for 2022. > 2020 Maserati MC20 begins body-on prototype testing The little camouflage we can see on this test mule resides at the front, disguising a mildly updated front bumper and grille – a fresh front and rear light design, as well as a new rear bumper are also to be expected. Mild changes should also be found in the cabin, although images are still yet to surface. Though power might see a mild improvement across the board, engine offerings are unlikely to stray from the current trio of 3-litre V6 petrol and diesel units. Today, the range-topper sends 424bhp and 424lb ft of torque to the rear wheels from a twin-turbocharged V6, enough for a 5.0sec 0-62mph time and 179mph top speed. Real changes are to come in the all-new car, a model that will directly compete with Jaguar’s upcoming all-electric XJ. Maserati has shown clear interest in pure-electric powertrains in recent times, but with the exciting new MC20 still featuring a combustion engine, time will tell if the next Quattroporte will go emissions-free... A release for the facelifted Quattroporte saloon is expected at some stage this year, with pricing likely to start at just shy of £80,000.
