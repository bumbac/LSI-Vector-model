Title: Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo spied – low-slung estate to join saloon

Text: Those wanting their spaniel to experience a Taycan Turbo S’s 750bhp launch control capability will soon be able to make it happen, as Porsche is diversifying the Taycan range with a new estate model. Called the Taycan Sport Turismo, it will feature the body already seen on the high-riding Cross Turismo concept, as revealed at the Geneva motor show in 2018, but sitting lower and without the rugged clip-on cladding. The Sport Turismo prototype in these images shares key design elements with the saloon too, but keeps the roofline level until further back in the body to create the estate-like silhouette. The tailgate will provide a much larger opening than the standard Taycan’s bootlid, making the space in the rear of the car more usable. The new estate shape should also improve upon the saloon’s rear-seat headroom, something that’s compromised by the steep slope to the four door’s roofline. > Audi RS e-tron GT prototype review – all-electric Taycan Turbo rival driven In Porsche’s usual fashion, the Sport Tursimo should share the same model line-up as the saloon, spreading from the entry-level Taycan 4 all the way up to the Turbo S. Under the new bodyshell, the Taycan’s J1 platform will be unchanged, so the Sport Turismo should drive almost identically to the saloon, save for a subtle shift in the centre of gravity. The top-level Turbo S’s technical highlights should also be shared with the saloon too, including three-chamber air suspension, an active body roll mitigation system, rear-wheel steering and that impressive launch control function that produces 750bhp on overboost. Precise details will be revealed as the Sport Turismo’s launch draws closer, but it does look like the Taycan’s unique combination of electric performance and contemporary style is about to be available in a more practical package.
