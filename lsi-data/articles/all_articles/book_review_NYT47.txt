Title: Long Before Her ‘Minari’ Oscar, Yuh-Jung Youn Won South Korea’s Heart

Text: Ms. Youn returned to Seoul to pick up acting again at age 38. South Korean society at the time still held deep prejudices against women who were divorced, forcing her to scrape by. With two sons to raise, she said she “never had the luxury of actresses who have wealthy husbands and can pick and choose movie roles.” “I did my work for survival and to put food on the table,” she told a South Korean TV station in 2009. “An actress can do her best work when she is most starved for cash. When you are hungry, you put your desperate best into your work.” Her versatility landed her roles as the femme fatale, the loving grandmother and even an over-the-hill prostitute. When producers were casting for “A Good Lawyer’s Wife” (2003), many female actresses declined the role of a woman who has sex with another man while her husband is terminally ill. Ms. Youn took the role, saying she could use the money to redo her living room. She once performed the role of a spiteful queen in a Korean soap opera so well that people often cursed when they saw her on the street. “People like her because they know her life story,” said Huh Eun, a retired college media professor in Seoul. “When they think of her, they don’t think of the glorious spotlight usually associated with film stars, but of a woman who has struggled to make a living all these years like the rest of us.” Ms. Youn’s global breakthrough came when she was offered a role in “Minari.”
