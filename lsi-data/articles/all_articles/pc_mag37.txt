Title: 38 Gmail Tips That Will Help You Conquer Email

Text: "Inbox Zero" is that marvelous zen state one achieves by having absolutely zero unread messages in an inbox. It's not easy, because email messages can be reminders of tasks or events. Worse, inboxes can be just like the inbox on a desk—piled high with stuff you've been avoiding. If you can't bear to mark a message as read in case you have to go back to it, or worse, would never, ever delete a message you might have to refer to later, you can still get to Inbox Zero. Simply archive the messages. That's what labels do—you are archiving messages under a label to find later. However, you don't need a label to archive messages. While reading a message or selecting it from the inbox, click the Archive button at the top (the file box with the down arrow), and the messages are stored out of sight by Gmail. Find them later with a search. There is no "archive" label, but you can look in the "All Mail" link toward the bottom of the left-hand navigation. Remember, archived messages still count against your Gmail storage—you're storing them. If you want to actually be rid of them and their attachments, drag the message to the Trash label, where they will remain for 30 days before permanent deletion. Better yet, get rid of frequently received and ignored messages that you can't delete, like receipts, by archiving them automatically using filters. Click a message, then go to the three-dot menu and select Filter Messages like these. A form pops up that will auto-populate info about the message (like who it's from); click Create filter, and check the options for where you want that message to archive. (I'd recommend Mark as read so you never get bothered by it in the future.)
