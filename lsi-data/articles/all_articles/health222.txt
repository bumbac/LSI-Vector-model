"It might be a little bit pinchy," says Dr. P as she starts to work on extracting the blackheads from her patient's neck. She first stabs a giant blackhead with a sharp tool, and from there she just uses her hands to squeeze out a big chunk of white gunk. She grabs a pair of scissors to help get everything out, then goes in with an extraction tool to keep pressing. And even more gunk comes out of it. As she works, she asks her patient what he does for a living that may be causing his skin to break out. "Do you work with a lot of chemicals, or things that make a lot of dirt or grease?" she asks. "We have a lot of dust and dirt with the machinery," the patient says.
