Title: Porsche unveils 911 Turbo S to match your £8m Embraer business jet

Text: Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur is renowned for its wild creations, from questionable body kits to lurid colour schemes. The special division has now created something a little more tasteful, collaborating with Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer for a limited-run, private jet-inspired 911 Turbo S. Limited to just ten units worldwide, the model is available to purchase for all buyers of the special edition Embraer Phenom 300E, a business jet with a starting price of just under £8m. No pricing information on the car has been disclosed, but we can’t imagine qualifying customers will be too concerned about the figure, whatever it is… > 992 Porsche 911 Turbo S 2020 review An identical silver and grey paint scheme to the jet's is immediately apparent, combining gloss and satin-gloss finishes for the first time on an official 911. Speed blue pinstripes are also applied by hand to match the aircraft, with the dark silver wheels featuring accents in the same shade. A unique logo designed specifically for the collaboration references the wings on both the plane and the Turbo, and is featured inside and out on both the aircraft and car. Perhaps most impressive is the inclusion of each jet’s individual registration number on the underside of the 911's active rear wing, also painted in striking Speed blue. Chrome trim around the windows and air intakes references the jet’s polished engine cowlings. Performance hasn’t seen an uplift, but although it will never quite match the 533mph cruising speed of the plane, it still has plenty enough go. A 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged flat-six sends 641bhp and 590lb ft of torque to the ground for a 2.7sec 0-62mph time and 205mph top speed.
