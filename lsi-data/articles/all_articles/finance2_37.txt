Title: Melinda Gates on running a foundation with Bill

Text: You can enable subtitles (captions) in the video player Let's get a little bit more personal. You and Bill, how do you divide your work? And what do you do when there's a disagreement? So how do we divide the work? Well, it's interesting. It's almost like passing a baton back and forth. If you just take Covid as an example, my gosh, we both have to stay deeply involved in what's going on because we gave an additional $1.75bn this year to Covid. So knowing where to put those investments down and where to shift, so we're both staying on top of the science. Then we sort of divide and conquer by areas of interest or where we feel like one of us has more expertise. So Bill will sometimes do a little bit more of the science, say, in agriculture than I will, but it's up to him and others to catch me up. And as I'm doing more pieces on the gender work and the data, it's up to me or others to catch him up. Do we disagree at times? Of course we do. I mean, all couples disagree about things. But what we committed to many years ago in the foundation was that we would have those disagreements outside the foundation, work them out, and come to the foundation as leaders with one voice. And that's our job to do, and we do it.
