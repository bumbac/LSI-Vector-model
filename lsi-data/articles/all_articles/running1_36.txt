Title: Best Phone Armbands for Runners 2021

Text: Many of us run with our phones—whether for mapping, streaming podcasts and music, or for safety reasons—but who wants to actually think about their phone while running? We’re all looking to get lost in our miles and enjoy the sense of freedom that comes with a sport that (allegedly) doesn’t require a lot of gear. A good armband helps you do that—it holds your phone without pinching, chafing, overheating, shifting, or bouncing—so you can focus on your form, or the road, or the pizza you’re going to destroy at the end of your run. But how do you find the right one for you? We put a box of running armbands to the test to find which do the best job of staying in place, hold our phones securely, and are the easiest to ignore, so you can at least feel unfettered by electronics, keys, cash, and ID while you run. How We Tested Every armband on this list has been evaluated and vetted by our team of test editors. We research the market, survey user reviews, speak with product managers and designers, and use our own experience running with our phones strapped to our arms (over shirts and jackets and right against our skin) to determine the best. We called in a pile of armbands, strapped them to our testers, and put in the miles to evaluate them on comfort, reliability, ease-of-use, sweat-wicking ability, fabric quality, aesthetics, how well they stay put, bonus features, and value. These are the ones we love.
