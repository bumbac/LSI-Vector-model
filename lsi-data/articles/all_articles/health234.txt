Title: Dr. Pimple Popper Pops Bowl Of 'Oatmeal' From Cyst In Instagram Video

Text: In Dr. Pimple Popper's new Instagram video, she helps a patient with a broken-down, liquefied cyst. The dermatologist slices open the skin and squeezes all the contents out with her fingers. Dr. Pimple Popper compares the contents to oatmeal as they come spilling out all over. Does anybody love a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast in the mornings? Well, if you answered yes I highly recommend heading elsewhere RN. Dermatologist Sandra Lee, MD, a.k.a. Dr. Pimple Popper, is working on a giant cyst and ruining your fave breakfast simultaneously. She's seriously talented, and this massive cyst is seriously stuffed. You probably guessed what's lurking inside the behemoth bump already. There's tons of oatmeal just waiting to be squeezed out. Dr. Pimple Popper gives a very clear warning in the caption: "Oatmeal before bed? ðŸ¤ª#drpimplepopper #shockingvideos" It's shocking and this is your last chance to watching something else before oatmeal is forever ruined.
