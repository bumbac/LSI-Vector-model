Title: 613bhp Alpina B8 Gran Coupe revealed – a flagship 201mph saloon

Text: Alpina has revived the B8 nameplate over 25 years since the E36-based original, this time applying it to a new model based on the M850i Gran Coupe. Designed to be a more subtle alternative to the M8 Competition, order books are open now with prices starting from £134,950. Under the bonnet is the same 4.4-litre N63 twin-turbocharged V8 as the M850i, but tweaks to the turbocharging and cooling systems yield an additional 90bhp and 37lb ft. As such, its 613bhp and 590lb ft of torque are only 9bhp down on the M8 and matching its peak torque figure, and make for a brisk 3.4sec 0-62mph time – an improvement of three tenths over standard. The standard speed limiter has also been removed, bumping top speed from 155mph to 201mph. > New Alpina B5 saloon and estate launched with 613bhp With an increase in power comes the requirement for improved heat management, and so Alpina has fitted bespoke intercoolers with 50 percent more cooling surface area and provided the 8-speed ZF automatic with an uprated transmission oil cooler. As with all Alpina models, the B8’s setup is focussed on comfort and on-road performance, fettling the M850i’s suspension setup accordingly. This includes detailed engineering changes such as new hydro mounts for the front struts which improve ride comfort, with new Eibach springs and adaptive dampers part of the package.
