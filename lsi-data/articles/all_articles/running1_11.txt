Title: Best Women’s Running Gear 2021

Text: There are more women runners out there today than ever before. In fact, ladies have outnumbered men in every race distance up to the marathon since 2014, according to data from RunningUSA.org. If you’re wondering why, Kathrine Switzer, one of the most badass female runners in history, has a few ideas: “She’s getting in her daily dose of empowerment, freedom, and fearlessness. She has put on her freedom wings for 20 minutes or two hours. That’s going to make her whole day right and her whole future hold up and seem entirely possible. The sense of her not having any limits, or any restrictions, to me, is so liberating.” But there are still some things about being a woman and a runner that aren’t always so liberating. (Think: uncomfortable sports bras and periods.) But with the right gear, these things don’t have to slow you down. We chose some of the best running essentials for feeling supported and stylish. How We Chose This Gear Every piece of gear on this list has been evaluated and vetted by our team of test editors. We research the market, survey user reviews, speak with product managers and designers, and use our own experience to determine the best options for your runs. In some cases, where we’ve gone deeper on a certain product, we included links to the full reviews. We hand-picked the gear below based on performance, price, comfort, technical features, and style to build this collection of essentials for women runners.
