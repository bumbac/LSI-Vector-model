Title: These RTX laptop deals from Razer are the real deal - save hundreds on the best in the game

Text: Getting a Razer laptop deal is a sweet, sweet gaming tech purchase. And even though we are into another generation of gaming machines given the new releases from both Team Green and Team Red, a deal on the most recent generation is still worthy of your attention. And that's exactly what's on offer now: you can save up to $500 on Razer's 20-series range of Razer laptops. But that's not all - you can also save up to $75 on orders at the Razer Store if you spend a certain sum - see more on that below. You'll get what you pay for with a Razer portable gaming machine, and that's one of the very best gaming laptops money can buy. The top-end of the gaming spectrum will always demand a weighty price of admission, but such large discounts cannot be ignored and definitely offer value: you're getting a sleek, well-built, powerful device from one of the best. There's a bunch of laptops on sale, but a few stand out to us and have been highlighted below for your convenience, as well as more information on that saving that can be had at the Razer Store. The laptops might not quite be the ones that are really in demand right now - the RTX 3080 laptop range, RTX 3060 laptop variants, or RTX 3070 laptop offerings - these, and any, that feature the 20-series of graphics card from Nvidia are still excellent. This is just an objective fact. What's more, you're getting other excellent components thrown into these builds to really double down on the quality: Intel 10th gen processors; 16GB of RAM, and all the laptops feature SSDs too. The laptop deals end on June 26th, and you also get a FREE Hitman 3 Gaming Bundle worth $100 thrown in, while the Razer Store promo offer ends tomorrow, Friday, May 7. Have at it!
