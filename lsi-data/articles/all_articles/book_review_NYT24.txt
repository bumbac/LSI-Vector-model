Title: Spanning Centuries and Continents, Novels of Our Common Humanity

Text: With its intersecting plots that rest on the slow but not so steady construction of an enormous church in medieval Alsace, Ben Hopkins’s novel has the look of an old-fashioned doorstop of a saga. But when you immerse yourself in the shifting perspectives of CATHEDRAL (Europa, 624 pp., $28), what you also discover is a clever (even postmodern?) commentary on the ironies of history. As he traces the fates of a lively scrum of characters, Hopkins shows how the seemingly firm hierarchies of one era can be grounded in the social strife — and sometimes sheer luck — of those that came before. In this nimble mesh of stories, a trading empire can have its roots in something as simple as the theft of a wig. And forbidden love can lead to a lonely death or to the birth, many years onward, of a whole new community. Image From its initial transaction, in which a shepherd bound in serfdom to the local bishop takes out a huge loan to buy his family’s freedom, “Cathedral” reveals the mercantile aspect of daily existence in the town of Hagenburg. This is a period in which guilds will tussle for influence with an increasingly penurious aristocracy, when pirates will brazenly extort payments for passage on the nearby river, when the bishop’s dwindling coffers will be refilled with the spoils of a hunt for heretics. Pious weavers, members of the Cathar sect, will lose their livelihood and their lives to an increasingly corrupt religious establishment. Jews will be forced to do business through Christian proxies. And a strait-laced prelate will be sent all the way to the “bordello” that is Rome in pursuit of his master’s claim to a wealthy parishioner’s inheritance.
