Title: Galaxy S10 review: Don't abandon Samsung's 2019 flagship just yet

Text: The poor Galaxy S10 always suffered from middle-child syndrome. Being sandwiched between the larger, more lavishly appointed Galaxy S10 Plus and the smaller, pluckier, far cheaper Galaxy S10E was never easy. In fact, I wondered more than once why it even existed, other than to suddenly look like a deal during promotional sales. 8.9 Samsung Galaxy S10 How it stacks up Apple iPhone 11 9.0 $600 Samsung Galaxy S10E 8.9 $265 Like Sharp screen Long battery life Noteworthy camera quality Wirelessly charges other devices Don't Like In-screen fingerprint reader is hit or miss Lacks the distinction of S10 Plus and S10E And now, the Galaxy S10's reason for being has become even more precarious. Samsung has since released the Galaxy S20, S20 Plus, Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra (not to mention the Galaxy Z Fold 2). The name change is significant, representing a major shift in what it means to be a premium Galaxy phone: 5G, real camera improvements and more megapixels, a huge battery, a 120Hz screen refresh rate. The Galaxy S10 can't compete against those specs, especially when it comes to future-proofing the phone in the rising age of blistering 5G data speeds. But for some people, the S10 could settle into the obvious choice for a high-end phone with a reasonable price, especially when the price inevitably drops even further. Angela Lang/CNET Yet for many, 5G phones won't be a practical option for several years. Buying a 4G phone this year that you hold onto for another two or three years isn't a terrible idea for many, especially if 5G still hasn't arrived where you live, and it means saving a sizable chunk of change. Specs wise, the Galaxy S10 will valiantly carry you through one more cycle of phone ownership -- just so long as it comes down to a price you're willing to pay. The Galaxy S10 initially started at $900 (£799 and AU$1,349), only $100 cheaper than the Plus ($1,000, £899, AU$1,499) and $150 more than the S10E ($750, £669, AU$1,199). Expect price drops to settle even further now that the Note 20 is here, with further seasonal discounts by store and carrier, such as buy one, get one free offers. The Galaxy S10 remains as terrific a phone as it was when I first reviewed it in March 2019. The screen, camera and battery life are top notch. That's unsurprising when you consider that it's just a pared-down version of the excellent Galaxy S10 Plus ( ), which was one of the top phones in a talent-stacked year.

The screen is slightly smaller (6.1 inches versus 6.4 on the Plus). Battery life is a tad shorter (just over 18 hours in our looping video drain test versus 21 on the Plus). There's no 1-terabyte storage option.
