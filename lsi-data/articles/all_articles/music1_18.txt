Title: Modest Mouse Announce New Album The Golden Casket, Share New Song

Text: Modest Mouse have announced a new album. The Golden Casket is out June 25 via Epic, and a new song called “We Are Between” is out now. The album was produced with Dave Sardy and Jacknife Lee in Los Angeles and at Modest Mouse’s Portland studio. Listen to the new song below. The new album follows 2015’s Strangers to Ourselves. In 2019, the band made a series of moves that appeared to anticipate the release of a new full-length, including the release of new songs called “Ice Cream Party,” “Poison the Well,” and “I’m Still Here” (none of which appear on the new album’s tracklist). That year, Modest Mouse also toured with the Black Keys.
