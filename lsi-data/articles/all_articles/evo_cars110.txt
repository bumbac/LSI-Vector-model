Title: 2021 Maserati GranTurismo teased – new GT coming with BEV and IC powertrains

Text: Maserati has revealed the first details of an all-new replacement for its GranTurismo model. As part of the company’s plan to launch 14 new or refreshed models by the end of 2023, the new GranTurismo confirms that while Maserati will be launching into new sectors and with new powertrains in the coming years, the GranTurismo and the accompanying drop-top GranCabrio will remain key models in the brand’s future. The new GranTurismo will launch next year with a similar silhouette to the current model, dominated by a long bonnet, curvaceous haunches and a four-seat cabin. However, the car’s aesthetic will be updated to align with new models like the MC20 supercar and incoming mid-size SUV, so expect to see more-upright oblong-shaped headlights and a repeat of Maserati’s new lighting signature in combination with the classic grille shape and C-pillar motif. Maserati has also confirmed that two very distinct powertrain options will be available on the new GranTurismo, with both all-electric and traditional internal combustion powertrains being offered. The electric GranTurismo, like all future electric Maseratis, will carry Folgore branding and will feature a total of three motors: one on the front axle and two on the rear, making it all-wheel drive. This triple engine configuration will also support torque vectoring on the rear axle, and will run on an 800V system – similar to the Porsche Taycan – to deliver exceptionally fast charging capabilities.
