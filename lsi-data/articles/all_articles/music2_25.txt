Title: Watch: Ann Rosén's graphite scores

Text: Based in Östra Hoby in the south east of Sweden, sound artist Ann Rosén's recent release In A Small Room is the product of an ongoing series of drawing sessions, streamed weekly on her YouTube channel. Rosén uses a self-designed computer software to translate graphite markings on paper into sound.  In an interview with Julian Cowley in The Wire 446, the artist explains how her practice revolves around breaking down barriers and expanding horizons. Rosén will often use workshops as stepping stones out of her own internalised barriers – the Drawing Music project itself developed from a group session working with children. “Workshops are a fruitful source of inspiration,” she reflects. “Those children were asked to compose music and to play small synths that I had built. To make this work, I invented an interactive composing pencil which they could use both to compose and play. It was fun, and it laid the foundation for what I’m doing right now, drawing with graphite.”  Read more about Rosén's inventions, projects and initiatives inside The Wire 446.
