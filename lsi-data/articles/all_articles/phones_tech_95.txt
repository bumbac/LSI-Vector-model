Title: Oscars 2021 results: The full list of winners, from Nomadland to Daniel Kaluuya

Text: Photo by Todd Wawrychuk/A.M.P.A.S. via Getty Images The 2021 Oscars are over and had a different, more relaxed vibe compared to previous years. Play-off music didn't even interrupt the speeches and history was made, with Chlo√© Zhao becoming the second ever woman to win best director and the first woman of color. Minari's Youn Yuh-jung won best supporting actress, the first Korean acting win in the show's 93-year history. Perhaps surprisingly, Anthony Hopkins won best actor for The Father, beating the late Chadwick Boseman who had been the favorite. The successfully hostless show came to a swift end after that result. Nomadland, from Chlo√© Zhao, won best picture and best actress for Frances McDormand, a whopping fourth Oscar win for the actress. Nomadland won three Oscars overall, the most on the night. Mank, The Father, Tenet, Judas and the Black Messiah, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, Soul and Sound of Metal were among those that took two. Daniel Kaluuya won his first Oscar for best supporting actor early on in the night, giving a memorably unconventional tribute to his parents. Check out the full list of winners for the 93rd award ceremony below.
