Title: Ford Racing Puma bodykit – Art of Speed

Text: Familiar with the Tickford Capri of 1982? Looking like a Group 2 machine that escaped Touring Car enslavement only moments before the sponsor livery arrived, it sported skirts and bumpers that draped provocatively to the tarmac and a blanked-off snout that gave it an unhinged demeanour. And yet despite the nefarious aesthetic and a 205bhp turbo V6, it sold poorly and was eventually killed off by the Sierra RS Cosworth, which was less expensive and even faster. Tickford’s take on Ford’s pert Puma nearly 20 years later was a similar story. This time the bodykit was considerably more curvaceous, but again the car was a commercial flop. In 2000 the Racing Puma came in at £22,750, whereas a Subaru Impreza Turbo cost £20,950, was much faster, more practical and had genuine motorsport pedigree, so no contest. In the end Ford’s ambition to shift 1000 cars proved way off the mark. Just half that volume was realised while something of a Scooby infestation took root in the UK. In fact, with fewer than 200 customer orders placed and marketing executives beginning to lose all hope, one of the greatest drivers’ cars ever to wear the blue oval would surreptitiously appear on Ford’s company-car scheme.
