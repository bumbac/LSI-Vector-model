Title: The 23 Best Lingerie Brands To Gift Yourself And Your Partner

Text: If I had to choose a favorite type of clothing, it would have to be lingerie (yes, even over my favorite pair of sweats). I remember as a teen being so excited to have a boyfriend just so I could have a whole new type of clothing to buy...till I realized I didn't want to wait. I went ahead and raided the local mall for sexy, silky, lacy things to wear to my bed on my own. Honestly, having a solo bubble bath followed by some massage oil and some candlelit time to read my favorite book without anyone interrupting me and my new outfit made me feel sexier than ever before. There was something about wanting to be my sexiest self just for myself that felt incredibly empowering. Sure, I love showing off some of my favorite pieces to my partner, too. Showing up to bed with a hot new outfit or sending a racy selfie paired with a good "See you tonight" text is an easy, lighthearted way to keep things fresh and fun (or give you a good reason to buy a new outfit). But lingerie is becoming a public trend, too. It's always fun to top a sexy lace bodysuit with a blazer and jeans for a night out or to pull your favorite turtleneck on underneath a satin slip. Whether you're in to vintage, floral pastel underwear, leather-clad strappy teddies, or a glam midi gown look, there's an option for nearly every budget, style, and mood. Below, check out some of the best brands to pair with your sexy solo time or partner, for a night in or out.
