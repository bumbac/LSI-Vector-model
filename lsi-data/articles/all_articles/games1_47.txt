Title: GI Show â€“ Resident Evil Village Review And Biomutant Hype

Text: On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been digging recently, including Resident Evil Village, the Famicom Detective Club games, Returnal, and Biomutant. Alex also squeezes in his book report on Ask Iwata: Words of Wisdom from Satoru Iwata, Nintendo's Legendary CEO. It's a full show, but we make time for another fantastic round of community emails and the epic return of Character Rankings. So please join Liana Ruppert (@DirtyEffinHippy), Kimberley Wallace (@kstar1785), Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76), and Ben Reeves (@Benjaminreeves) for another wild and ever-entertaining episode!
