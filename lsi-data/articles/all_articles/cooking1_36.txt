Title: A Sweet and Savory Spring Brunch

Text: As we all know, brunch combines two meals into one: breakfast + lunch = brunch. Brilliant. I’m not much of a breakfast person (meaning not a morning person), so I lean toward the “-unch” part of brunch. My guests may arrive when it’s still morning, but rather than sweet breakfast treats, I serve up dishes with plenty of savory notes and only hints of sweetness. In this menu, a galette plays this balancing act beautifully: It’s full of healthful greens and tangy cheese, yet the crust nods to the buttery pastries we love with early-morning coffee. Strawberry crostini hold the same sweet-savory tension, with a hint of fresh basil to balance the cinnamon toast. One key aspect to successful brunching is a menu that doesn’t require the cook to be too energetic in the early hours—or at least this cook! Most of this menu can be prepped the night before or definitely long before guests arrive. No stressing over egg-poaching or being tethered to the waffle iron. The only bit of timing that needs attention is removing the lemon-lime pudding cake from the oven when the filling is still a tiny bit wobbly, creating the perfect contrast to the souffle-like top layer—once again, proving that balance is the key.M Menu Timeline
