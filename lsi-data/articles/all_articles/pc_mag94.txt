Title: Boost Website Traffic With This $25 SEO Tool

Text: There are millions of websites out there, and the competition for that first page of Google search results can be more than a little intimidating. No matter how many feelers you put out there on social media or how many ads you run, you can still seem invisible to the right audience. That's why web marketing can be a full-time job—one for which busy entrepreneurs may not have time for. The good news is, the art of search engine optimization isn't really an art, it's a science, and one that's perfectly suited to a tool like SERPstash Premium. This invaluable marketing helper is designed to save time and drive traffic, whether you're shepherding a small niche site or the internet face of a booming company. Within minutes of firing it up, you can get an eye-opening readout on your existing SEO and how it stacks up against your competitors. Without making any changes to the site, try different keywords and find out who is ranking high for those same terms. Once you find some terms that don't pick up a ton of viable results, you've found your niche—and SERPstash can show you how to exploit it. It achieves this by building a strong array of backlinks to your site, and the more you use it on your page, the smarter it gets. You'll get updates on the current ranking of your site on Google and Bing, plus readouts on exactly what queries are bringing people there. You can even get tips on improving your site's speed and mobile compatibility. Right now, PCMag readers can get a lifetime subscription to SERPstash Premium for $24—95% off the $500 MSRP. Prices subject to change.
