Text: You can enable subtitles (captions) in the video player Good evening. Your patience is commendable. We knew this was going to go long, but who knew we're going to go into maybe tomorrow morning, maybe even longer. But look, we feel good about where we are. We really do. I'm here to tell you tonight, we believe we're on track to win this election. Yes. We knew because of the unprecedented early vote and the mail-in vote, that it's going to take a while. We're going to have to be patient until the hard work of tallying votes is finished. And it ain't over 'til every vote is counted. Every ballot is counted. You know we could know the results as early as tomorrow morning, but it may take a little longer, as I've said all along, it's not my place, or Donald Trump's place to declare who's won this election. That's the decision of the American people. But I'm optimistic about this outcome. Keep the faith guys, we're going to win this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
