Title: GI Show – The Mass Effect Spectacular

Text: On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been playing recently, such as: Into The Breach, Pikmin 3 Deluxe, Yakuza Kiwami 2, Persona 3 Portable, Vampire: The Masquerade – Coteries of New York. Then we take a break to deep dive on Mass Effect Legendary Edition, which recently graced our cover. It's a full show, but we make time for another fantastic round of community emails at the end. So please join Joe Juba (@Joejuba), Kimberley Wallace (@kstar1785), Liana Ruppert (@DirtyEffinHippy), Alex Van Aken (@itsVanAken), and myself for another wild and entertaining episode!
