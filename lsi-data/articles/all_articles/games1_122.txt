Title: GI Show – New Pokémon Snap And Returnal Reviews

Text: On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been digging recently, including New Pokémon Snap, Returnal, and Judgment. Sure that's not a long list of games, but they are pretty great games. Next, we take some time to reflect on the new Mortal Kombat film. Is it worth a watch? Listen and find out. It's a full show, but we make time for another fantastic round of community emails.
