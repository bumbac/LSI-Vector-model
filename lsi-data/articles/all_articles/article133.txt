The boxer has just won the heavyweight title when he and friends gather in a Florida hotel room. Rounding out the foursome are star NFL running back Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge) and crooner Sam Cooke ("Hamilton's" Leslie Odom Jr.), who are skeptical about Malcolm X's pitch, if only because of what it would mean, they joke, about giving up porkchops and drinking. What ensues is a timely conversation about the civil-rights struggle, the conflicting demands of celebrity, and the benefits and dangers associated with leveraging one's platform to speak out.
