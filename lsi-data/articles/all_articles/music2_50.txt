Title: Watch Rob Noyes performing in Kumegawa, Tokyo

Text: Five years since the release of his debut solo acoustic record The Feudal Spirit, Tokyo based guitarist Rob Noyes is set to share his second album Arc Minutes via US label VDSQ. “With the first record” says the musician, speaking to Tony Rettman in The Wire 444, “I was still getting comfortable with the technical side of playing, having just switched from primarily being a bass player to fingerstyle guitar. I was really concerned with the recording and the room. With this new one, it was recorded in a bunch of different places and I’m now able to play more involved rhythmic ideas, which I’ve always intended to be the focus of the music.”  Filmed by Vincent Guilbert in Kumegawa, Tokyo in October 2020, this video takes in three compositions from the album. “It’s more based on the textures coming from the playing than anything I did on the first record,” Noyes says of the featured track “The Sniper's Dream”. “I always wanted to write something where I could challenge myself to really control the sound and now I have the ability to play something like that.”  Read the full interview in The Wire 444.
