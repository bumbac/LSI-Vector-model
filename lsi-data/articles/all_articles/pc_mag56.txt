Title: Beavers Take Down the Internet in Canada

Text: (Photo by Tim Umphreys on Unsplash) There are many reasons your internet connection stops working, but "beavers" probably isn't one you'd expect to hear from an ISP. However, that's exactly why the internet went down for some Telus customers in Canada over the weekend. As CBC reports, the incident was explained as a "very bizarre and uniquely Canadian turn of events," by Telus spokesperson Liz Sauv√©. Even though the cable was buried and protected by a 4.5-inch conduit, a team of very hard-working beavers managed to dig up and use their powerful teeth to chew right through it. In a statement, Telus said, ""Our team located a nearby dam, and it appears the beavers dug underground alongside the creek to reach our cable, which is buried about 3 feet underground and protected by a 4.5-inch thick conduit. The beavers first chewed through the conduit before chewing through the cable in multiple locations." The good news it, human engineers have restored service for the 900 customers in Tumbler Ridge, B.C. impacted by these beaver engineers. The animals also now have some high-quality conduit and cable helping to keep their dam strong. The bad news is, those human engineers now have to figure out how to protect the cable from being damaged again in future. A metal conduit, perhaps?
