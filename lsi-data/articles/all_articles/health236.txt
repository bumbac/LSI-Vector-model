Title: This Back And Shoulder Workout Builds Serious Upper-Body Strength

Text: Want to build a stronger upper body with minimal equipment? This no-gym-required back and shoulder workout is just what you need. Having a strong back and shoulders is important for everyone—but there's more to it than just being able to hoist heavy stuff up onto the highest shelf of your hallway closet. It also keeps your posture looking (and feeling!) proud and can even minimize unhelpful upper-body rotation when you run, making you more efficient so you can log more miles. Plus, healthy back and shoulder muscles also help open up your chest, giving your lungs more room to expand, which helps you breathe easier all day long. Lucky for you, you don't need a pullup bar (or anything fancy, really) to sculpt those muscles. This eight-move back and shoulder workout is designed to attack these important muscle groups from all angles with just two types of equipment—a pair of dumbbells (water bottles or canned goods work in a pinch) and a resistance band—so you can build upper-body strength anywhere. Another reason this workout is so great: You can totally customize it to your fitness level. If needed, you can increase your rest or shave down your rep counts by two or three reps per set. Or, for an extra challenge, cut down on that rest time or add a couple of reps to each set. Ready to set your back and shoulders on fire? Of course you are. Equipment needed: dumbbells, resistance band Time: 25 minutes Instructions: Perform the indicated number of reps of each exercise below, then rest for 15 seconds, and continue onto the next move. Once you've completed all eight exercises, rest for one minute, then repeat the entire circuit twice more for a total of three sets.
