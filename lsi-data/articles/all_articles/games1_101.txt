Title: Replay â€“ Bioshock Infinite

Text: When Irrational Games released the original Bioshock in 2007, the failed utopia of Rapture enraptured captivated players in a way few first-person shooters ever had. Many thought the story of Andrew Ryan and his crumbling world would never be equaled or topped, that is until Bioshock Infinite came along. Following Booker DeWitt, players took on the assignment of finding a powerful captive named Elizabeth and freeing her from the steampunk hellscape known as Columbia. While somewhat divisive, Infinite continued the series' storied tradition of keeping players on their toes and telling one of the wildest stories on the last generation of consoles. Join Andrew Reiner, Dan Tack, Joe Juba, and me as we ready our sky-hook and take to the dystopian streets of Bioshock Infinite.
