Title: 13 Best Cross-Training Shoes For Women In 2021

Text: Your workout is only as good as the shoes on your feet. That’s especially true when it comes to cross-training, which calls for all kinds of movement: front to back, side to side, up and down, you name it. If you’re going to go HAM in a HIIT or bootcamp workout, you need a shoe that can handle everything from box jumps and cardio machines to weight lifting. Not only will the right shoes enhance your performance, but a secure and comfortable fit can help you prevent injury, too. But what should you look for in a pair of cross-training shoes? “I think it’s important to find a sneaker that provides a moderate amount of cushion and support without feeling bulky or like you're wearing clown shoes,” says Lindsey Clayton, a trainer at Barry's Bootcamp and co-founder of Brave Body Project. “My biggest pet peeve is when my foot slips inside my shoe, so a build-up on the side of the foot to keep it secure is important to me too (especially if you're doing lateral movements).” Cross-training is a valuable part of any fitness routine. It challenges your muscles to go beyond their limits by adding some variety to your exercise plan. Unfortunately, your go-to workout sneakers may not be the best fit to take you from running to weight-lifting. That said, choosing any kind of workout shoe is a seriously personal decision. To make that choice a little easier, read up on the latest and greatest cross-training shoes from solid fitness brands.
