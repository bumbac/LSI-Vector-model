Title: DS Divine concept driven – the future of French luxury cars?

Text: This is not a Citroen. It might be built by Citroen, but the DS Divine concept has never worn a Citroen badge and never will; it is the physical manifestation of the French firm’s dedicated DS luxury brand, launched alongside the concept at the 2014 Paris motor show. Nor does it preview any production car directly, Citroen or otherwise. It’s a C-segment car in size – think DS 4, or the current Citroen C4 – but unlike many modern concept cars, the DS Divine is purely a design exercise, previewing distinctive DS attributes rather than a future vehicle in its entirety. Finally, this is not a vehicle we can dynamically assess to any degree. It’s certainly driveable – a step beyond many concept cars, which are rolled into their spots on motor show stands and rolled away again. But our drive was limited to little over 30mph and, with respect to those who built it, this is not a car we’d be comfortable driving much quicker. The reasons for this we’ll get to shortly. First, one must stand back and appreciate the styling. There’s a lot to take in, and were the overall shape not so cohesive your eyes wouldn't know where to focus first. The basic form is simple, but the voluptuous curves are a world away from any current vehicle in the Focus/Golf/Astra class.
