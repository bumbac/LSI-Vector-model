Title: The Lighter & Stronger Shimano EP8 E-Bike Motor

Text: Whatever you think about e-bikes, keep in mind that you only think it about today’s e-bikes. About the e-bikes that you know. But things change. Technology evolves, design follows, and the e-bikes of tomorrow will be lighter, more efficient and more intuitive. Yes, they will still be motorized bicycles, but they will be better motorized bicycles. A lot of riders who had abstained for practical, not puritanical reasons, will join the club as a result and, for better or worse, e-bikes will become that much harder to ignore. The latest major step in that direction was the release of the Specialized Turbo Levo SL. With a little less torque and a little less weight, one could say it started bridging the gap between the electric mountain bikes and normal mountain bikes. It got us thinking, but today, an even more significant development in the e-bike debate comes in the form of a new motor from Shimano, the EP8 Photo Credit: Shimano Bike The existing Shimano E8000 motor is arguably the most popular motor in mountain e-bikes. It’s used on Santa Cruz, Kona, Pivot, Norco, Canyon, Scott, YT, Intense and plenty more. The new motor, called EP8, is 10 percent smaller and is a lot lighter. The compact size and a magnesium casing helped cut 300 grams. And that’s just the motor unit. The smaller size and lighter weight also allows frames themselves to be more compact and lighter, and it will be less necessary to spec heavier e-bike-specific parts like forks and wheels. Use of the EP8 will eventually be as widespread as that of the E8000, so the monopoly held by the Specialized Turbo Levo SL will likely be short-lived.
