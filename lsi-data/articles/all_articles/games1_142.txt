Title: GI Show – Hitman 3, Resident Evil Village, And IO-Interactive Interview

Text: On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been playing recently, including Hitman 3, There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension, When the Past Was Around, and Valorant. We also run down all of the recent Resident Evil Village news. At the end of the show, we interview IO-Interactive's game director Mattias Engström and executive producer Forest Swartout Large about their work on Hitman 3 and how they design levels with comedy in mind. It's a full show, but we make time for another fantastic round of community emails in there somewhere. So please join Jeff Cork, Liana Ruppert, Alex Van Aken, and myself for another wild and ever-entertaining episode! Thanks for listening!
