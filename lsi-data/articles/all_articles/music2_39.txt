Title: Watch: Holland Andrews “Gloss”

Text: “In an era of restriction”, writes The Wire 445 featured vocalist, clarinettist, composer and performance artist Holland Andrews over email, ““Gloss” plays with the ways in which we can still find magic within the limitation, transforming our conceptions as to what we thought we needed in order to find bliss.” Andrews (formerly known as Like A Villain) is talking about the idea behind their latest single “Gloss”, the lead track from forthcoming electronic EP Wordless.  “Filmed on smartphone and with digital sparkles created in an app”, Andrews continues, “the “Gloss” music video aims to cultivate joy that is simply felt for the sake of feeling joyful and nothing else. What does one gain from integrating magic and play into our sense of awareness for our own excitement? Freedom.”  In George Grella's interview with Andrews in The Wire 445, the artist speaks more about their forthcoming EP, how they've recently re-evaluated and adapted their practice to the current landscape, as well as THERE YOU ARE, an ongoing series of phone-based “personalised microperformances”.
