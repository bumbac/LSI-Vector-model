Title: Nissan Leaf Nismo - Electric hot hatch debuts in Japan

Text: Nissan has finally revealed a production variant of the Leaf Nismo, the warmed-over EV first presented in concept form at the 2017 Tokyo motor show. Looking almost identical to the concept and based on the production Nissan Leaf now on sale across the world, the Nismo version focuses mainly on chassis and visual enhancements, though Nismo does promise a retuned computer to improve response to accelerator inputs. The subtext of that is that the Nismo is unlikely to produce any more power than the standard Leaf’s 148bhp output. If the changes unleash more torque we may still see improvements on the existing model’s 8.3-second 0-62mph dash, though the upshot is that we’re looking at a warm hatch rather than a hot one. Still, the performance was among the new Leaf’s stronger suits when we first drove the car before the Tokyo show last year. More of an issue was the car’s unremarkable handling, which should be improved with the addition of uprated dampers and a revised stability control program, along with new 18in alloy wheels and ContiSportContact 5 tyres. > Nissan Leaf review - bring on the Nismo, then we'll talk... The electric power steering has also been re-adjusted for its new application, as has the ABS, while Nissan’s Intelligent Trace Control - which can brake individual wheels to reduce understeer - has been retuned to match the car’s new dynamic abilities.
