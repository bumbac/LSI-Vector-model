Title: How to watch Girls5eva: stream the new Tina Fey comedy everywhere

Text: Sending up - while also paying affectionate homage to - the girl groups of the â€˜90s and '00s, this Sara Bareilles-led comedy show has all the ingredients for a smash hit. Exclusive to Peacock, here's how to stream Girls5eva, no matter where you are in the world. The show follows the now forty-something members of 90s group Girls5eva who have faded into obscurity after their 15 minutes of fame delivered just the one hit single. But their time in the wilderness comes to a surprise end when their sole smash record gets sampled by a famous rapper, giving the band an unlikely chance for a second shot at stardom. The four remaining members swiftly aim to relaunch their career at the prestigious Jingle Ball mega concert, before realising they'll need a new set of songs as their somewhat creepy old tracks have aged as well as Britney and Justin's double denim look. Produced by 30 Rock's Tina Fey, Robert Carlock, and Jeff Richmond and written by Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt show runner Meredith Scardino, the show stars Busy Philipps, Renee Elise Goldsberry and Paula Pell alongside Bareilles as members of the revitalised group.
