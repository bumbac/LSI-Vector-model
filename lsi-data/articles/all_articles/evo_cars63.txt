Title: UK-based tuner Litchfield announces Toyota GR Yaris tuning programme

Text: Litchfield has announced it’s in the midst of developing a tuning program for the new Toyota GR Yaris, one of the most highly anticipated new performance cars to hit the road in the past 12 months. With high demand for the Yaris from customers, it has subsequently led to an influx of demand for Litchfield tuning packages and performance parts. Components in initial development include a full and cat-back exhaust system with and without particulate filter delete options, a new intake system, ECU remap and an uprated intercooler. Given the GR Yaris’ engine engine is already the world’s most powerful turbocharged three-cylinder, power upgrades are expected to be subtle initially, given the already highly-strung nature of the engine in its factory tune. Litchfield are confident that its initial packages will be able to liberate an extra 30-40bhp from an initial ECU tune, subtly lifting boost without deteriorating the car’s drivability or disrupting the torque curve. As well as increasing power, Litchfield also has a variety of chassis upgrades in the works, including an interior roll-cage, new polyurethane bushes, more aggressive bucket seats with new lower mounts (addressing one of few complaints in the standard GR Yaris) and two new suspension systems at different price points that will both lower the standard ride height, yet increase the standard system’s dynamic range over rough UK roads. Given the extensive tuning scene around Japanese performance cars, not to mention its connection to Toyota’s rally exploits, it’s not surprising to see the tuning community quickly adopting the new GR Yaris. With such immense performance and capability from the factory, it will be a fascinating exercise to see how experienced tuners like Litchfield affect the GR Yaris’ driving characteristics, while imbuing it with their own personality.
