Title: Philip Roth, ‘Middlemarch’ and Other Letters to the Editor

Text: His Life as a Man To the Editor: I have been a reader of the Book Review for more than 50 years, but I have never written in. Cynthia Ozick’s review of “Philip Roth: The Biography” (April 11) changed my mind. Simply put: This is the single best written book review I have ever read in my entire life. I have been a loyal reader of all of Philip Roth’s books, and now Blake Bailey’s astonishing biography. Ozick, who is a gifted writer, absolutely brings to life, in her peerless prose and perceptiveness, the character of both Roth and the biography itself. Roth was one of the deans of American literature in the 20th century. Full stop. Whatever his critics may have said — and are saying — his 31 books are a testament to a life well written. Ozick’s review is so beautifully written, so eloquent, so challenging, that I wish she too had written the Roth biography. Blake Bailey’s gift as a biographer — so evident with his book on John Cheever — is astonishing, and Ozick’s appreciation of that writing is remarkably generous. Her final sentence is worthy of Tolstoy and should be taught in every English class in this country: “What remains on the page is one writer’s life as it was lived, and — almost — as it was felt.” Bravo Cynthia Ozick, bravo Blake Bailey and bravo Philip Roth. Evan Charkes Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. ♦ To the Editor: Next time you assign a review for a new biography, try not to choose a partisan for the job. Ozick only briefly mentions the author of the latest Philip Roth biography before devoting the bulk of her bulky review justifying the problematic Roth and his uneven oeuvre. She is particularly harsh on the legion of women Roth dumped, dismissively stressing they were all “ardently consensual.”
