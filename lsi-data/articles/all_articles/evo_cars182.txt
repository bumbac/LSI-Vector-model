Title: Facelifted Porsche Panamera GTS 2020 review

Text: Three simple letters: GTS. While they’ll never have the cachet of Porsche’s GT2, GT3 or GT4 badges, they still represent some of Porsche’s best driver’s cars, from the fantastic Cayman GTS 4.0 to the most focused variants of Macans and Cayennes. The Panamera GTS has always been a favourite too, and for Porsche’s latest round of updates arrives with an engine retuned for top-end response and fresh-faced styling. Engine, transmission and 0-60 time The GTS’s motivating force comes from a familiar twin-turbo four-litre V8. While it makes significantly less power than the similar unit in the Turbo S (473bhp at 6500rpm plays 621bhp), Porsche has tuned it to deliver an increasing gallop towards the red line, mimicking the characteristics of a naturally-aspirated motor. There’s a new sports exhaust too, which should amplify the V8’s voice in our era of petrol particulate filters. There’s 457lb ft of torque on offer between 1800 - 4000rpm, so despite the top-end bias there’s no shortage of twist, and with an eight-speed PDK and all-wheel drive the results are 0-62mph in 3.9sec (despite a 2040kg kerbweight) and 181mph. Technical highlights Porsche has recalibrated both its active suspension and dynamic chassis control electronics across the Panamera range, the former to improve comfort and the latter to improve the response of its active anti-roll system. Beyond that, changes to the latest Panamera, GTS included, are largely aesthetic, with the old Sport Design front bumper now applied across the whole range (bar the new Turbo S), updates to the front and rear lights, and new alloy wheel designs. What’s it like to drive? It’s funny what constitutes a sporty character these days, but simply by being audible under every press of the throttle, even in the most placid driving mode, the GTS immediately feels more engaging than most luxury performance saloons.
