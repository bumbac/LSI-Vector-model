Title: The best TV for PS5 and Xbox Series X: get the best experience on next gen consoles

Text: Picking out the best TV for PS5 or Xbox Series X is crucila to getting the most out your super powerful new consoles and we're here to show you the best options across a range of budgets along with where to buy them for the best price. You'll be surprised how affordable some of them are as the biggest brands and retailers compete for your hard-earned cash. Just finding PS5 stock and Xbox Series X stock has been hard enough, but thankfully choosing a great TV to go with it is nowhere near as tough as we're spoilt for choice in all honesty. There’s a lot more to the PS5 and Xbox Series X than fast loading speeds and fancy UIs as this next generation of consoles also ushers in a new era of display technology. So if you really want to see what your new console is capable of, you’ll want to consider a new TV for your PS5 or Series X. That old 1080p LCD telly from 2012 just isn’t going to cut it with these behemoths. If you haven’t yet made the leap to an Ultra HD/4K resolution TV, now’s the time, you may find prices are much lower than you expected as 4K no longer means expensive. Our price comparison technology scans all the best stores to make sure we show you the best online price out there too. Skip to: While the new consoles will obviously display 1080p, and look great doing it, 4K with HDR is where things start to get interesting. Much has been made of the PS5 and Xbox Series X’s ability to output high-frame-rate 4K, that’s to say 4K at 120fps, but for the most part, you should expect 4K 60fps to be the default standard for both models, at least in the short term. The good news is that all modern 4K TVs of note have HDMI connectivity supporting 4K at 60fps. Consider 4K at 120fps the icing on the cake. The big techs are QLED screens and the best OLED TV -aim for these if you want the top experience going. Equally ubiquitous are dedicated Game modes. These tend to eliminate picture processing to reduce input lag. Low input lag is vital when it comes to competitive gaming, but is largely irrelevant if you’re spending your time on Animal Crossing. Low input lag without all that processing sugar and spice, means eye candy gets lost. This is why Samsung offers two tiers of Game Mode - more of which later. Unacceptable input lag for gaming on a TV is anything higher than 30ms. Some of our chosen screens offer a blistering 15ms or lower. Other niceties to look for are VRR and ALLM. The latter is more common than the former. ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode) allows a TV to automatically switch to Game mode when it receives an ALLM signal from your console. When an ALLM signal ends, the TV reverts to its previous picture mode. It’s a convenience feature, simply put. HDMI VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) is a standard adopted by game consoles that allow games to supply a TV with a frame as soon as it is rendered. This ensures low input lag, and eliminates the judder and tearing artifacts which can be seen if a frame is sent at a fixed frequency that doesn’t align with the rendering speed. In short, HDMI VRR is a good thing, although you’ll only find it on more expensive TVs. The only TV maker currently offering VRR and ALLM, along with high frame rate 4K video is LG. So which is the best TV for PS5 and/or Xbox Series X? Read on for our recommendations, but here's a deal that caught our eye today. LG CX OLED | 55-inch | $1999 $1,349.99 at Amazon A fantastic price for the most in-demand PS5 and Xbox Series X television we've seen in recent months. It always goes quickly so it might well be worth considering pulling that trigger. View Deal The best TV for PS5 and Xbox Series X Just show me the very best TV for PS5 and Xbox Series X (Image credit: LG) 1. LG OLEDCX series Formidable gaming specification and excellent image quality makes LG’s CX series a hot option for high-end gamers Sizes: Sizes: 48, 55, 65, and 77-inches (OLED48CX6, OLED55CX6,OLED65CX6, OLED77CX6) | Input lag: 13ms (1080/60) | Display type: OLED | Refresh rate : 120Hz | HDR: Dolby Vision, HDR10, HLG | VRR: Yes | HDMI 2.1: Yes £1,198 View at John Lewis & Partners £1,198 View at very.co.uk £1,658 View at Amazon Excellent image quality Ticks all the display boxes Four HDMI 2.1 inputs OLED can suffer from image retention UK models lack Freeview Play and mainstream catchup TV apps LG’s mid-range 4K OLED is arguably the best specified of all the current crop of high-end UHD TVs. Image quality is outstanding, with superb dynamics, black level and shadow detail. Unusually, the CX boasts four HDMI 2.1 inputs. Most sets offer a mix of 2.1 and 2.0, or simply lack 2.1 altogether (we’re looking at you Philips and Panasonic). Features include VRR (Variable Refresh Rate), ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode), and 4K at 120Hz. If you want a screen that does it all, then the LG CX is an excellent choice. The only caveat is image retention (aka burn-in), which can be an issue for OLED, when images remain static on screen for too long. All in all, though, this was the clear winner in the gaming TV category in our recent GamesRadar Hardware Awards. More 120Hz gaming models (Image credit: Samsung) The Q70T may lack the Full Array Local dimming backlight found higher up Samsung’s 2020 QLED range, but it compensates with an affordable price tag and dynamic picture performance. One of the least expensive 4k TVs to offer 4K 120fps support, the Q70T won’t break the bank, but will show your games console in the best light. The fourth HDMI is the one that’s 4K 120fps ready, the remaining HDMIs are all 4k 60fps enabled. Another neat feature is Mobile Multi View with Casting, which allows the TV image and your smartphone to be viewed simultaneously, useful if you’re playing a game while following a YouTube walk-through. Like all of Samsung’s QLEDs, there are two Game Modes. Game Motion Plus achieves low input lag, but still maintains elements of picture processing for the best possible picture quality. Input lag in this mode is a respectable 20ms. Game motion Plus can be switched off, which then unleashes a blisteringly fast 9ms input lag (1080p/60). (Image credit: LG) 3. LG G1 LG's latest is another winner and already selling out fast in the US Sizes: 55, 65 and 77-inches (OLED55G1, OLED65G1, OLED77G1) | Input lag: 12.7ms (1080/60) | Displaytype: OLED | Refresh rate: 120Hz | HDR: Dolby Vision, HDR10, HLG | VRR: Yes | HDMI 2.1: Yes £1,999 View at PRC Direct Check Amazon Incredible display Game optmizer is a great addition Packed with HDMI 2.1 ports You'll have to pay extra for feet or a stand if not wall-mounting A quick up and down scroll on this page will show you that when shopping for a top TV for your PS5 or Xbox Series X, LG is one of the best brands out there. Brand new to 2021 and the newest TV on this list we're big fans of the gorgeous LG G1. It would be even higher on this list were it not for two things. It keeps selling out and is quite hard to find, and more annoyingly, you'll have to pay extra for feet or a pedestal stand if you're not planning on wall-mounting it. Poor show, LG. It's a good thing you've got one of the best screens we've ever seen and an excellent game optimizer mode that lets you swap between presets modes for first-person shooter, RGPS and RTS titles. Latency is super low you have four HDMI 2.1 ports, which is fantastic for running compatible titles at 120Hz. The new Web OS platform is super smooth too and is much better at browsing through multiple streaming services. But it's the OLED EVO panel that's really won us over with exceptional brightness and naturally sharp images. Motion handling has never been better too for gaming and movies alike.

LG Nano90 Nanocell LED Don’t overlook LG’s Nanocell LED screens when it comes to gaming displays Sizes: 55-, 65-, 75- inches (55NANO906, 65NANO906, 75NANO906) | Input lag: 17ms (1080/60) | Display type: LED | Refresh rate : 120Hz | HDR: DolbyVision, HDR10, HLG | VRR: Yes | HDMI 2.1: Yes Prime £962.04 View at Amazon £1,299 View at PRC Direct Solid picture performance Free from image burn Two high-speed HDMI inputs Losing contrast when viewed off angle LG’s OLEDs tend to hog the limelight, but its Nanocell screens are an intriguing LED-based alternative. This 9-series model sports two high-speed 4K 120 fps compatible inputs, handy if you’re planning to play in both camps. It’s a mid-range performer when it comes to HDR brightness, but full array dimming keeps the dynamics nice and tight. This, coupled with relatively low image lag, makes for a good gaming screen. The set is also compatible with HDMI VRR and ALLM. (Image credit: Sony) 5. Sony X900H / XH90 If you’re looking for a PS5-ready 120Hz Sony TV, this is the one Sizes: 55, 65, 75, and 85- inches (KD-55XH9005, KD-65XH9005, KD-75XH9005, KD-85XH9005) | Input lag: 17ms (1080/60) | Display type: LED | Refresh rate: 120Hz | HDR: Dolby Vision, HDR10, HLG | VRR: Yes | HDMI 2.1: Yes Check Amazon Superb image engine Powerful Android smart platform Two high-speed HDMI inputs VRR / 4K 120 fps firmware update not fully rolled out yet Image artifacts in dark scenes on native Netflix app If you want a Sony TV to showcase your PS5, hurry past those Sony OLEDs and take a long look at this model, as it promises support for 4K 120fps (via a firmware update which has started rolling out recently). Sony’s image processor is one of the best out there, and it’s particularly adept at upscaling non-HDR and HD content - basically Sony’s image engine makes everything look good. There’s support for ALLM and VRR too, at least when Sony enables the latter via firmware. Input lag is bonza at 15ms (1080p/60). Editors note: I had one of these TVs in for testing recently, and while I found it was excellent for gaming, I was really disappointed with the native Netflix app as it struggled with dark scenes with lots of blocky image artifacting (this never happens when gaming though). Pop a Fire TV stick in though and problem solved - Brendan Griffiths. Craving that 120Hz rush but not found something above? We've got a wider selection of suitable models in our best 120Hz TV guide. The best PS5/Series X TV picks on a budget (Image credit: Vizio) 6. Vizio V Series 2020 The US TV brand delivers a solid budget option for gamers with the LED flatscreen Sizes: 40-, 43-, 50, 55-, 60-, 65-, 70-, 75- inches (V405-H19, V435-H11, V505-H19, V555-H11, V585-H11, V605-H3, V655-H9, V705-H3, V755-H4) | Input lag: 10ms (1080/60) | Display type: LED | Refresh rate: 60Hz | HDR: Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10, HLG | VRR: No | HDMI 2.1: No Check Amazon Bargain basement price Low input lag 4K 60fps HDMI input Low brightness HDR No 120fps high frame rate support The V Class Vizio screens are aimed at buyers on a tight budget, and as such, they don't come with a whole stack of game-centric features. They’re more HDR-compatible than HDR-able, as screen brightness just isn’t very high, but if you’re after a TV that won’t put you at a disadvantage when in a melee, they’re well worth a look. There’s no VRR support, but input lag is stupendously low, and the screen will work happily with 4K at 60 FPS. Budget bargain or stop-gap panel? Maybe a bit of both… Vizio TVs are mainly only available in the US. We rarely see them in the UK. (Image credit: Samsung) 7. Samsung TU8000 / TU8500 This Samsung Crystal UHD could be the best budget gaming TV for the Xbox Series X and PS5 Sizes: 43-, 55-, 65-inches (UE43TU8500, UE55TU8500, UE65TU8500) | Input lag: 12ms (1080/60) | Display type: LED | Refresh rate: 60Hz | HDR: HDR10+, HDR10, HLG | VRR: No | HDMI 2.1: No Check Amazon Vibrant, colour rich images Ultra-low input lag 4K 60fps HDMI input No VRR No 120fps high frame rate support Samsung’s QLED UHD flatscreens are the glory hounds, but the brand’s Crystal UHD models, like this TU8000 model, sell by the truckload, and it’s easy to see why. Picture quality is striking, the brand’s Tizen smart platform is first class, and input lag is wonderfully low. The inevitable budget caveat is that there are only three HDMIs, with no 120fps frame rate support. Given the asking price, that’s hardly a surprise. There’s no VRR but we do get ALLM. Just like Samsung’s QLED models, there’s Multi View simultaneous smartphone/TV viewing and we get two Game modes. Game Motion Plus delivers at 26.7ms (1080/60), while the hardcore Game mode comes in at a stonking 11.7ms (1080/60). (Image credit: Panasonic) 8. Panasonic TX-50HX800 A beautiful mix of Hollywood tuned imagery and low input lag, this mid-ranger is perfect for games and movies Sizes: 50-, 58-, 65-inches | Input lag: 10ms (1080/60) | Display type: LED | Refresh rate: 60Hz | HDR: Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10, HLG | VRR: No | HDMI 2.1: No £589.97 View at Appliances Direct Prime £597.97 View at Amazon £599 View at very.co.uk Universal HDR support Low input lag 4K 60fps HDMI input No VRR No 120fps high frame rate support Panasonic’s HX800 is a mid-range UHD TV that’s tuned for movie lovers, but has a blisteringly fast game response with 4K 60 fps HDMI inputs. For many buyers, this could be the ideal living room compromise. One consequence of its advantageous price point is the provision of just three HDMI inputs, which could be a problem if you’re aiming to buy both the PS5 and Xbox Series X. There’s no VRR (all the HDMI’s are v2.0), but we do get ALLM and input lag is hugely impressive at just 10.2ms (1080/60). A great all rounder. This particular Panasonic model is rarely available outside of Europe. Want to check out some of the latest TV deals at the best retailers?
