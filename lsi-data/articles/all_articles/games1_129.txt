Title: Watch The April Resident Evil Showcase With Game Informer

Text: While there have been a plethora of great titles through the first few months of 2021, we've seen a wide swath of the AAA experiences get pushed to later this year and beyond. Resident Evil Village has been an outlier though, and with its May 7 release date rapidly approaching, Capcom is once again lifting the curtain on one of the biggest titles of the year. But what can fans expect to see from this month's brand new digital showcase? The last time we heard from Capcom, fans of the series were inundated with new gameplay, a peek at the company's plan to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the series, and so much more. But will Lady Dimitrescu and her hauntingly beautiful band of vampires make another appearance? Will we finally find out more about Chris Redfield's turn to the dark side? I think you'll have to tune in to find out. And what better people to watch the Resident Evil showcase with than with your friends at Game Informer. Dan "The Jacket" Tack will be joining me as we watch along with you and provide the hottest takes and best insight you come to expect from GI.
