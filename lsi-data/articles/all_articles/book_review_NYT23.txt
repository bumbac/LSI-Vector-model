Title: New & Noteworthy Poetry, From Sign Language to Robot Saints

Text: Recent poetry books of note: INDEX OF WOMEN, by Amy Gerstler. (Penguin Poets, paper, $20.) Gerstler’s witty collection channels various characters — the tooth fairy, a lost doll — to celebrate “shrewd, / ingenious, difficult women, prodigal daughters / and wisecracking wives.” THE PERSEVERANCE, by Raymond Antrobus. (Tin House, paper, $16.95.) Intimate and searching, the poems in this lively debut probe the author’s identity as a deaf Jamaican British man; sign language illustrations appear sporadically, and one poem is a scornful riposte to Ted Hughes’s “Deaf School.” CLEAVE: Poems, by Tiana Nobile. (Hub City, paper, $16.) Harry Harlow’s famous study, raising baby monkeys with wire or terrycloth “mothers,” runs as a motif through this collection about the poet’s experience as a Korean-American adoptee. “Call me Rhesus,” she writes, “monkey without a cloth.” OH YOU ROBOT SAINTS!, by Rebecca Morgan Frank. (Carnegie Mellon University, paper, $15.95.) As the title suggests, Frank’s fourth book centers on the mechanical and the divine, especially on human efforts to bridge the gap, to create “a hawk from a handsaw.”
