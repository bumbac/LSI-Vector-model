Title: Biomutant â€” New Gameplay Today (4K)

Text: Let's take a trip back. Back to 2017, when the world was eagerly anticipating the release of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and pandemics were reserved for Steven Soderbergh movies. Four years ago, developer Experiment 101 announced Biomutant, an intriguing open-world RPG. The game features bizarre yet adorable anthropomorphic creatures in a post-apocalyptic world and was supposedly dropping in 2018. But then, the calendar started to turn, and the window came and went. But now, with the official release date of May 25 rapidly approaching, Biomutant's arrival is imminent, but will it live up to the years of anticipation and hype? While we won't know the full answer to that question until the official release, our preview time with Biomutant is making all the right impressions. Experiment 101's open-world feels alive and jam-packed with tons of weird enemies to fight, gorgeous skylines to gawk at, and a bounty of traversal options to keep players moving. Join Marcus Stewart, Blake Hester, and Alex Stadnik as they take you on a tour of Biomutant! We take you around the colorful world, show off the game's fluid mix of melee and long-ranged combat, and discuss what players will be doing during their time in this charming new title. We even show you the newly announced photo mode that I'm sure we'll all spend far too much time in instead of progressing the story. If you enjoyed this video, be sure to check out Marcus' recent Q&A preview of the game, a look at the open world, and an explanation of why Biomutant's development took as long as it did! After four years of waiting, Biomutant is set to launch on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, but where are your hype levels at? Be sure to let us know (respectfully) in the comments about what you're looking forward to from Experiment 101's newest title!
