Title: GI Show â€“ Resident Evil Village Hands-On And Nier Replicant Review

Text: On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been digging recently, including Resident Evil Village, Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139..., Oddworld: Soulstorm, MLB The Show 21, Before Your Eyes, and There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension. At the end of the show, we interview Greg Russo (@WriterRusso), the screenwriter for the new Mortal Kombat film. We talk to him about why Kano is fun to write and how he's adapting Space Invaders onto the big screen. It's a full show, but we make time for another fantastic round of community emails. So please join Liana Ruppert (@DirtyEffinHippy), Jason Guisao (@Jason_Guisao), Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), Andrew Reiner (@Andrew_Reiner), Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76), and Ben Reeves (@Benjaminreeves) for another wild and ever-entertaining episode!
