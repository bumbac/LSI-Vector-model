Title: GI Show â€“ Aliens: Fireteam And It Takes Two Impressions, What We Want From Elden Ring

Text: On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been digging recently, including Maquette, Outriders, Rogue Heroes: Ruins of Tasos, Aliens: Fireteam, and It Takes Two. Then we reflect on the recent Elden Ring trailer leaks as we dream about what we'd like to see from From Software's next title, and what possible contribution author George R.R. Martin (Game of Thrones) brings to the table. It's a full show, but we make time for another fantastic round of community emails. So please join Dan Tack (@dantack), Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76), Liana Ruppert (@DirtyEffinHippy), Jeff Cork, and Ben Reeves (@Benjaminreeves) for another wild and ever-entertaining episode!
