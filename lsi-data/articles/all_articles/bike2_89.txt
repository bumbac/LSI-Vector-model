Title: 6 Ways to Fix the Most Common Cycling Pains

Text: Low Back Pain Common culprits: Saddle too high or too low; poor core strength; mashing gears and/or too much differential between your saddle and bar height. Try this: First check your position. If your hips are rocking side to side as you pedal, your low back is taking a beating—lower the saddle until they’re stable. If it’s too low, your knee has to come up above hip level at the top of the pedal stroke, which also can flex and stress the low back. Next check your posture. You should aim to have a flat back with normal low-back curvature. If your spine is rounded, you’re stressing your back. Roll your pelvis forward to create a neutral spine. Adjust the cockpit of your bike to maintain that position. Often that means bringing your handlebars and saddle closer to level with each other. [How to Treat Low Back Pain] “Everyone wants to look like Peter Sagan with a super high saddle and slammed stem, but they’re rounding their spines and stretching out the paraspinal muscles, which support the spine and control movement between the vertebrae,” says Schmidt. “Those muscles are like Velcro, when you stretch them too far, they can barely hold on to support you and absorb the force from your pedaling legs.” Speaking of force from your legs, mashing a super hard gear is like doing leg presses with zero back support. Shift down and raise your cadence to take some stress off your back. Then check your core strength. You should be able to take your hands off the bars (not while riding please) and comfortably maintain that neutral spine flexed position. If you can’t, it’s time for some bridges and deadlifts to strengthen your supporting muscles.
