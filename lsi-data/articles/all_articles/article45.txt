Title: Shopping for a car? Watch out for the 'destination fee'

Text: (CNN) When buying a car, there are a lot of things you can choose to pay for. There are navigation systems, leather seats or an extended warranty, for example. But there's one cost you won't be able to duck, and one you won't see rolled into the advertised sticker price: the destination fee.

It's usually listed at the bottom of a new car's price sticker after the price of the car itself. , according to an And, over the past decade, those fees have increased rapidlyaccording to an investigation by Consumer Reports . Destination charges have gone from an average of $839 in 2011 to $1,244 in 2020, according to the Consumer Reports . That's more than 2.5 times the rate of inflation. It may seem weird, but federal law requires that these fees must be tacked on separately. Automakers aren't allowed to just include the shipping cost in the final price of the vehicle, the way it's done for virtually every other product we buy.

Likewise, for a Ford Expedition with its $1,695 destination fee. Read More
