Title: 10 of the Best Rail Trails in the U.S.

Text: Just about every cyclist can appreciate a good rail trail. The terrain is usually tame, there are no cars to contend with, and theyâ€™re a great introduction to longer ridesâ€”like centuries. Here, weâ€™ve listed the top 10 of best rail trails you can find in America, and why each one belongs on your bucket list. Great Allegheny Passage Jon Dawnson/Flickr Location: Cumberland, Maryland, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Length: 150 miles Learn more Why itâ€™s great: When you connect the crushed limestone Allegheny Passage with the 184.5-mile C&O; Canal Towpath in Cumberland, you can ride all the way from Pittsburgh to D.C. without having to worry about busy streets or traffic. Itâ€™s the perfect place to try your first week-long bike tour. Katy Trail State Park Ken Ratcliff/Flickr Location: Machens to Clinton, Missouri Length: 240 miles Learn more Why itâ€™s great: The crushed limestone Katy Trail is one of the longest rail trails in the country, and runs nearly across the entire midsection of Missouri. Itâ€™s not only steeped in historyâ€”over half of its length follows Lewis and Clarkâ€™s path along the Missouri Riverâ€”but itâ€™s also a great place to explore Missouri wine country, with wineries easy to access from the trail.

Silver Comet Trail and Chief Ladiga Trail Location: Smyrna, Georgia, to Anniston, Alabama Length: 95 miles Learn more Why itâ€™s great: Starting in Georgia, just outside of Atlanta, cyclists can take on both trails together for nearly 100 miles of scenic riding through two states.
