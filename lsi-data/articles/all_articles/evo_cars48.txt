Title: Alpina B4 Biturbo coupe and convertible specs, UK prices and pictures

Text: Alpina has announced it will be bringing two new cars to June’s Goodwood Festival of Speed, the B4 Biturbo coupe and B4 Bi-Turbo convertible. Based on BMW’s latest generation of 4-series, the B4 Biturbo produces 404bhp and 442lb ft of torque from its twin-turbocharged 3-litre six-cylinder engine. Based on the standard N55 BMW straight-six unit from the 435i, Alpina chose to double the number of turbos and in the process uprate cooling as well as adding a new crankshaft. Pushing power through BMW’s eight-speed auto ‘box, the uprated powertrain can accelerate the car from 0-62 in 4.2secs in rear-driven coupe spec, whilst the 225kg heavier convertible takes 4.5secs. In left-hand drive countries buyers can spec four-wheel drive, which improves traction to shorten the same sprint to 4.0secs. Top speed is 188mph for the coupe and 187 for the convertible. Alpina claims that 37mpg and CO2 emissions as low as 177g/km are possible. That may not be as impressive as the D3 Biturbo diesel equivalent (which produces 53.3mpg and 139g/km of CO2), but with the petrol’s stronger desire to be revved – as shown by the 5,500 revs required to reach peak power – it should be a more rewarding drive.
