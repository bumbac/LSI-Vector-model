Slideshow: Party-Ready Aussie Lamb Recipes You can also feel good about serving Australian lamb to your family. It’s produced with great care for the animals and the environment. The lambs graze on natural grasslands throughout their lives, so the meat is all natural and free of artificial additives. There also are no added hormones, and lamb is a source of lean protein. Australian ranchers pride themselves on being stewards of the land and are committed to protecting their natural resources for future generations. Australian lamb is chilled and aged to ensure premium eating quality. So whether you’re pan-searing loin chops or slowly braising shanks until the meat is fall-off-the-bone tender, you’ll be happy you brought healthy, flavorful, and ethically raised Australian lamb to the table.
