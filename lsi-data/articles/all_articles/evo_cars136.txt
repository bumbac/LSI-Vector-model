Title: Datsun 240Z – review, history, prices and specs

Text: 2019 marks 50 years since one of Nissan’s, and indeed Japan’s most important ever cars first went on sale. It’s the 50th anniversary of the ‘Z-car’ (cooler if pronounced with the American ‘zee’), a lineage that began with the 240Z way back in 1969. The Z was only ever a small player in the UK, but it virtually built the Datsun, and subsequently Nissan brands in the United States. It created a legacy that has continued to this day, most recently through the characterful, if long-in-the-tooth 370Z. > Click here for our review of the Nissan 370Z Nismo A resurgence in popularity has seen Z-car prices rise in recent years, but their roaring desirability, at least in the US, means choice is still relatively plentiful, if you’re prepared to import a left-hand-drive car. For the styling, character and driving entertainment they deliver, there are few attainable classics that match it. 12 Datsun 240Z in detail The Datsun 240Z story starts with Yutaka Katayama, tasked with bringing the Datsun brand to the United States in the early 1960s. Early products, mostly small utility vehicles, sold slowly, but Katayama saw a gap in the market for small sports cars like those produced by the British, and 1963’s 1500 Fairlady roadster achieved reasonable success. Cleverly, Nissan didn’t rest on its laurels with the 240Z. While the car was still dominating on the racetrack – Sharp, as well as John Morton and Paul Newman all drove examples – Nissan worked on upgrading the 2.4-litre engine, with the 2.6-litre 260Z arriving in 1974. The power increase was modest and the performance increase minimal, but they did offset extra emissions controls introduced to combat pollution and fuel efficiency worries. Styling tweaks were minor too, though a slightly less elegant 2+2 model brought extra practicality. The Zed was upgraded again from 1975 for the US market only, becoming the 280Z, with a corresponding increase in capacity and small improvements in power and torque. As was common at the time, safety regulations and styling trends saw larger plastic bumpers sprout from either end, harming the Z’s lines. It, and the 260Z in other markets, carried on the Z line until the S130-chassis 280ZX arrived in 1978. By this point the Z had become more of a grand tourer than a sports car, a trend continued by two generations of 300ZX in 1984 and 1990, but the 350Z of 2003 brought things back to basics for the nameplate, putting performance and design at the forefront.
