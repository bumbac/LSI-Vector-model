Title: GI Show â€“ Deathloop Cover Reveal, Curse Of The Dead Gods, And Loop Hero

Text: On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been digging recently, including Maquette, Minecraft, Curse of the Dead Gods, Loop Hero, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and StarCraft II: Nova Covert Ops. Then we talk about the latest game to grace the cover of Game Informer Magazine, Arkane's Deathloop. It's a full show, but we make time for another fantastic round of community emails. So please join Marcus Stewart (@MarcusStewart7), Alex Van Aken (@itsVanAken), Dan Tack (@dantack), Brian Shea (@BrianPShea), Jeff Cork, and Ben Reeves (@Benjaminreeves) for another wild and ever-entertaining episode!
