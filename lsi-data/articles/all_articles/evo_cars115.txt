Title: Novitec Maserati Levante takes output to 615bhp

Text: The Maserati Levante Trofeo is one of the quickest SUVs on the market, with a Ferrari-derived, twin-turbocharged V8 under the bonnet providing a 572bhp output. Now in its second iteration, Novitec’s Levante Esteso pushes numbers even further, whilst adding a number of cosmetic tweaks. Thanks to the addition of the tuner’s new engine control unit, power from its 3.8-litre twin-turbocharged V8 now sits at 615bhp and 605lb ft of torque, good enough for an impressive 192mph top speed and a 3.8sec 0-62mph time, three tenths quicker than standard – that’s an increase of 43bhp and 66lb ft over the factory figures. The brand will also up power on any other Levante model, including the V6 diesel. > Maserati Levante Trofeo review – is the most powerful series-production Maserati ever worth its £125,000 price tag? As you’d expect from a Novitec product, it’s a touch wider than before. The use of front and rear carbonfibre arches increases width by 10cm at the front and 12 at the rear (2.09m in total), for better lane-filling ability than a Lamborghini Aventador. A new carbonfibre lip can also be found at the rear for added aggression, and at the front, buyers receive a new carbonfibre bonnet piece to set it apart from an ordinary example. Of course, the rolling stock has also increased in size, with 22-inch center lock-look wheels wrapped in 295 front tyres and 335 rears – these are available in either matte or gloss black finishes. In order to lift the new wheels into the widened arches, Novitec tweaks the factory air suspension for a 25mm reduction in ride height. Elsewhere, buyers can opt to have various interior tweaks, and should you own a diesel-powered model, you can even choose Novitec’s ‘active sound system’ to add artificial exhaust noise where the engine lacks it. Pricing and availability is yet to be revealed.
