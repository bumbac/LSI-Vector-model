Title: NordVPN Sale: Final Chance for 68% Off the 2-Year Plan

Text: NordVPN is one of the world’s leading VPN service providers, and the company is offering one last chance to save on a two-year deal. If you sign up for two years of service with NordVPN now, you will save 68% on the regular retail price. NordVPN provides top-notch protection and security to keep your data safe. The company routes your data traffic through multiple servers and uses split-tunneling to ensure that your data is untraceable. The company also has a large number of servers available across the globe. Streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu restrict content to different areas, so a movie or TV show may be viewable by a customer in Canada, for example, but not in the US. By connecting to a server in Canada, however, you can bypass this limitation and gain access to a wider range of content. Due to its rich feature set and excellent service, NordVPN earned an excellent review from PCMag and an Editors’ Choice award. The biggest complaint reviewer Max Eddy found with the service was that it's a bit costly, but the company’s current promotion solves that issue. When you sign up for NordVPN’s two-year subscription service, you will pay just $3.71 per month, a 68% discount compared to the regular price. This comes out to just $89 for the entire two years. This deal ends soon, though, so sign up now so you don't miss out.
