Title: Heather Rae Young And Tarek El Moussa‚Äôs Relationship Timeline

Text: Selling Sunset star Heather Rae Young and HGTV mainstay Tarek El Moussa are immersed in wedding planning as they count down to their big day. Until then, Heather's making their romance official with a Tarek tattoo on her tush. The phrase "Yes Sir, Mr. El Moussa" is forever immortalized on her butt. And if all the couple milestones these two have already passed is any indication, this relationship seems built to last. In under a year, Heather and Tarek started dating, hung out together with Tarek's kids, moved in together, and capped it all off with a romantic marriage proposal. But hey, when you know, you know, right?  This whirlwind romance began in July 2019, and while the journey to finding each other was a little bumpy, these two were so sure of one another when they met that they committed to being exclusive on their second date. Here's the full timeline of Heather Rae Young and Tarek El Moussa's relationship from the very beginning: July 4, 2019: The two meet when Tarek spotted Heather on a yacht near his own. You might even say there were fireworks when Tarek honked his horn to get Heather's attention and asked her out. At the time, the Flip or Flop host had finalized his divorce from co-host Christina Anstead a year prior and was six years out from recovering from two types of cancer, according to House Beautiful. Heather, meanwhile, was in another relationship at the time and turned Tarek down, but she must have also been feelin' the love that day because paparazzi spotted the the two canoodling a few weeks later on July 28 on a yacht in Redondo Beach, Calif., People later reported. "I‚Äôll never forget the first time I saw her," Tarek recently wrote on Instagram. "It was the last thing I ever expected but I met the love of my life. The second our eyes connected and we smiled at each other I knew my life would never be the same." This content is imported from Instagram.

While the couple didn't publicly reveal their relationship status on Instagram until August 8, both noted in their anniversary posts this week that they had actually decided to have "the talk" during their second date.

August 13, 2019: The couple appears in their first interview together. Dressed up and looking very much in love, the two discussed their relationship with PeopleTV for their first joint interview. While both are still filming their own reality shows for their respective networks, unfortunately, there won't be any Selling Sunset/Flip or Flop crossover episodes happening anytime soon. "I‚Äôd love him to but, unfortunately, right now because of his work and his contract, he can't be on the show," Heather tells Women's Health of Tarek appearing on Selling Sunset. "Having a reality show and not being able to show the biggest parts of my life, Tarek, you know... it's been a little bit difficult because I want him [to be] a part of my show and my life. And yeah, it's been like a little missing piece to the puzzle." This content is imported from {embed-name}.

I was rushed around the corner to what I thought would be a dinner on the sand. But when I walked around the corner Tarek was standing there looking so handsome in his tux. I was confused for the first 15 seconds as I walked down the gorgeous candle & flower aisle wondering what the heck is going on. Then I thought OMG is he proposing??? No way!!!! But in my head I talked Myself out of it thinking well I bet it‚Äôs earrings!!! I didn‚Äôt want to get my hopes up." This content is imported from Instagram.

August 2020: Heather starts planning for a summer 2021 wedding. While she and Tarek haven't settled on an exact date, they do have a good idea of what they want for their special day already. One thing is for sure, they don't want it filmed. Unfortunately, Selling Sunset fans likely won't get to watch the couple say "I do" on Netflix. ‚ÄúI think Tarek‚Äôs and mine will probably be a very intimate but very beautiful wedding. We‚Äôre still trying to decide how big, how small,‚Äù Heather told People. ‚ÄúBut right now, we‚Äôve talked, and we‚Äôre leaning towards no, not having it filmed.‚Äù Like Tarek's romantic proposal, they're looking at California beach venues. ‚ÄúWe have not chosen a specific date, we‚Äôre looking at a couple different locations‚Äîwe want to do it in California somewhere on the beach,‚Äù she told People. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thinking within this next year. So probably summer 2021." Heather also started her hunt for the perfect wedding dress. She shared all about shopping and crowdsourced ideas from followers on Instagram: "So I tried on wedding dresses on Monday with my beautiful mama. What a special day it was. I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling. I was envisioning myself walking down the aisle towards @therealtarekelmoussa and thinking what would he love me in. When he sees me I want him to say Wow she‚Äôs mine! üòä" This content is imported from Instagram.

His ex, Christina Anstead, will not get an invite and neither will Ant. "We have a very civil, great relationship with them for the kids. The kids are number one, that‚Äôs the most important, but that‚Äôs kind of where it stops,‚Äù Heather says. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I would like to have his ex at my wedding.‚Äù November 2020: Heather and Tarek sample wedding cakes.

Heather tapped tattoo artist Sean Arnold‚Äôs studio for her "special Valentine‚Äôs Day present," PageSix reported. Initially, Heather was going to keep it private. "It‚Äôs very meaningful because I‚Äôm doing it for my fianc√©," she said in the video. "It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs just for us, so you might not see it. But this guy right here is going to hook me up." Heather shared a photo of the new ink, which reads "Yes Sir, Mr. El Moussa," before deleting her post. Feb. 23, 2021: Heather explains why she deleted the tattoo pic. Just hours after she posted the picture, Heather deleted it from her social media. Weeks late, she explained to Us Weekly that she received so much backlash that she decided to take it down. "It was completely taken out of context, and the whole meaning of it was blown way out of proportion," she said. "And so, obviously you saw, I took it down. We woke up the next morning, and it was, like, so much negativity surrounded by something that was meant for my fianc√© and meant with so much love." Heather also noted that deleting the pic only got more people talking about it, even though it was an attempt to move on. "We took it down, which then stirred up more controversy," she told the publication. "But, you know, I don‚Äôt like negativity. I don‚Äôt like negativity on my page. I don‚Äôt like to read negativity. It really upsets me. And so, I‚Äôd rather just take it down and move on from that." Heather also shared more about what her and Tarek's nicknames mean and how they use them at home. "It‚Äôs something cute we do around the house," she said. "It‚Äôs like, you know, Daddy‚Äôs the boss and Heather‚Äôs the boss. And so, he‚Äôll say something... and then I‚Äôm like, 'Yes, sir, Mr. El Moussa.' And he‚Äôll say, 'Yes, ma‚Äôam, Ms. El Moussa.' ‚Ä¶ I know that they say names are the kiss of death for tattoos, but it‚Äôs [going to be] my last name too, right?" And apparently, Tarek is considering getting a similar tattoo with Heather‚Äôs name. "We actually talked about that," she said. "He‚Äôs like, 'I‚Äôm going to get your name.' And I‚Äôm like, 'Okay, well, what name are you going to get?' I don‚Äôt know if he will, to be honest. But, you know, maybe he‚Äôll get it in the same spot. I don‚Äôt know." Feb. 24, 2021: Heather talks about being a stepmom. Since getting engaged to Tarek, Heather has also taken on the role of stepmom to his two children with his ex-wife Christina, Taylor, 10, and Brayden, 5. This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site. "The hardest thing is I‚Äôm raising humans, and I‚Äôve never raised a human before," she told Us Weekly. "I never had the time to prepare to be a stepmom. Most moms, you know, they have the time they‚Äôre carrying the baby. They‚Äôre prepped to be a mom. I never had that prep time. I was just thrown into it completely." She also added that it can be "a lot to juggle and a lot to manage"‚Äîbut she‚Äôs "doing a pretty rock star job." She also added that the coolest thing about being a stepmom is watching the kids grow and change in front of her eyes. "We‚Äôre just such a tight family now, and it‚Äôs so special to watch them grow," she told the publication. "I‚Äôve never seen children grow up in front of my eyes. ‚Ä¶Every week, we get them back [from their mom], and I get to see them changing. It‚Äôs so cute. I‚Äôve never experienced this before and it‚Äôs so special." Heather also credits Tarek with being super supportive and creating an environment of open communication with Christina. "We coparent very well, and we communicate very well‚Ä¶ either through text or in person," Heather said. "We help each other out when we need it. If we need to borrow something, we let each other borrow things." And in case you were wondering, Heather also added that she "get[s] along great" with Christina and called her a "great mom."
