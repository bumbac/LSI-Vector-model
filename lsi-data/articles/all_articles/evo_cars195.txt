Title: New Citroen C3 revealed - Cactus inspiration and WRC effort for French supermini

Text: Citroen has revealed the latest iteration of its C3 supermini, set to go head-to-head with class rivals including the Ford Fiesta, Renault Clio and Volkswagen Polo. While the last C3 played things safe - the more upmarket and visually stimulating DS 3 has proved far more popular in the UK market - the latest C3 takes a leaf (or perhaps a spine) from the Citroen C4 Cactus, with more adventurous, youthful styling and the return of the Cactus’s ‘Airbumps’. The new C3 is recognisably a modern Citroen, with a wide grille flanked by two headlight layers. It results in a fairly chunky, SUV-like appearance to the front end, but in profile there’s a curve to the roofline that’ll be more recognisable to those familiar with the previous two generations of the C3 nameplate. It’s clear that Airbumps - the polyeurethane, air-filled pockets that line the sides of the car - are becoming a signature Citroen design feature, having first made their debut on the characterful C4 Cactus. Here they’re an option - think of them as glorified door rubbing strips - but certainly add to the character of the C3. The rear has echoes of other Citroen models, most notably the C1, as well as a hint of the DS 3, while the alloy wheels are cribbed from the Cactus and the car’s colour lines, such as the white, black and red seen here, are very much modern Citroen features.
