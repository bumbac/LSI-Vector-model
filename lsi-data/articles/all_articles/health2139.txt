Title: How to Make Sunburn Heal Faster

Text: Sunburns are an absolute pain (literally). A sunburn is essentially unprotected skin that is injured by ultraviolet radiation, according to Adam Friedman, MD, FAAD, professor of dermatology at George Washington University. "These are charged molecules that are physically injuring our cells, our proteins, and our fats," Dr. Friedman says. Too much UV exposure causes inflammation, redness, and sometimes *a lot* of discomfort (you know that itchy, tingling feeling you experience after a sunburn). Of course, if you can prevent sunburns altogether, that's ideal—because a sunburn (even a suntan, btw) increases your risk of developing skin cancer. But hey, sometimes you forget to reapply before—or maybe you've purposely skipped out on our SPF to ensure proof of a well-deserved vacay (tisk, tisk). No matter the reason for the burn, you're going to want some quick and easy methods of relief, especially considering that a sunburn can last anywhere between a few days and several weeks. There are no magic overnight sunburn fixes (sorry!)—but there are a few things you can do to fast-track your healing. You want to focus on products that restore moisture back to your skin (think: lotions and creams) and relieve peeling or itching (think: ice packs or OTC pain relievers). For legit recommendations, follow this dermatologist-recommended treatment plan for fast sunburn relief. Your skin will thank you.
