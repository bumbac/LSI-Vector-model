Title: The 25 Best Sunscreens For Face 2021

Text: Wearing sunscreen on your face is an absolute must. In fact, you should be wearing it at all times. That means during every season of the year (yes, winter too!) and even if you're just sitting inside all day. Wondering why? Well, according to experts, skipping on sunscreen is pretty dang dangerous for your skin.  When it comes to appearance, the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays can cause issues like discoloration, fine lines, and wrinkles. But more importantly, being over-exposed to UV light puts you at a huge risk for developing skin cancer says New York-based dermatologist Marnie Nussbaum, MD. "UV rays even go through windows," she explains. "Which is why it's critical to wear sunscreen daily on your face, even if you're just staying home." And while slathering on SPF seems pretty doable (how hard can it be to incorporate one more skincare product into your beauty routine?), the problem is that many formulas can be thick, goopy, and leave behind obnoxious white streaks (especially if you've got a darker skin tone). That said, we tapped dermatologists to get their picks of the best sunscreens for your face no matter your skin type. Whether you've got acne prone skin or dry skin, whether you're looking for a dewy glow or a matte finish, there's a sunscreen for you. Because TBH, sun protection should be a no-brainer, not an eternal struggle.
