Title: Huawei Plans to Launch 6G in 2030

Text: (Photo: Shutterstock) The world is only just starting to get used to 5G networks and 5G phones in our pockets, but Huawei is already thinking about the future with plans for a 6G rollout. As CGTN reports, Huawei Chairman Xu Zhijun used the company's global analyst conference in Shenzhen to announce that it intends to launch 6G equipment and subsequent networks in 2030. A white paper is also planned in which Huawei will tell the industry what 6G is. As our own Sascha Segan explains in his tech rant video below, "the ideas for 6G are really, really crazy." 5G in theory goes up to 100GHz for transmitting data, but for 6G, scientists are looking at the terahertz range, meaning extremely tiny and fragile waves, but spectacular data rates if they manage to pull it off. Huawei intends to be the first to do so. If Zhijun is to be believed, Huawei's take on 6G will be 50 times faster than 5G when it arrives in less than nine years. Of course, it won't arrive in the US if the current trade ban continues or escalates, but then Huawei won't be the only company working on 6G technology over the next decade. For now, 6G is something for scientists and engineers to worry about, but if they get this right, we could be living in a truly connected world by the mid-2030s.
