Title: Trek Recalls 2014 and 2015 Farley 6 Fat Bikes

Text: Trek announced today that it is issuing a recall in conjunction with the Consumer Product Safety Commission on 2014- and 2015-year Farley 6 fat bikes and framesets. The 2016 and 2017 models are unaffected. According to Trek, the connection of the fork to the steerer is affected, which could cause a separation at the base of the steerer tube. Consumers have reported noise and the feeling of a loose headset in affected bikes. The recall includes 4,635 bikes globally, 2,665 of which are located in the United States; there have been no reports of injuries as yet. Owners of the affected bikes and framesets are asked to stop riding them immediately and take the models to their nearest Trek dealer for a replacement fork and installation on the bike. As a measure of good faith, Trek is offering a $100 gift card to owners of each bike involved. The gift cards are good for redemption on Trek or Bontrager products.
