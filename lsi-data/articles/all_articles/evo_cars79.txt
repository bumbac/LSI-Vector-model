Title: Next generation Toyota Mirai revealed as hydrogen flagship

Text: Toyota has revealed a near-production concept version of its second-generation Mirai, the marque’s hydrogen fuel-cell saloon. While battery electric vehicles are quickly gaining momentum as the environmentally friendly option for private car buyers, hydrogen fuel-cell technology has been in constant development alongside it, with manufacturers such as Toyota, Honda and Hyundai all now having production fuel-cell models on the road. Tellingly, the new Mirai is built on Toyota’s modular TNGA platform, one shared with everything from the Prius to the Camry, helpfully reducing per-unit production costs of a model that has always been a loss-leader due to its expensive hydrogen fuel-cell powertrain. Unlike a traditional internal-combustion powertrain, the hydrogen fuel-cell works by generating electricity by a chemical reaction with no associated emissions aside from water vapour. This electricity then powers an electric motor, which in the Mirai’s case sits on the rear axle, providing drive. Toyota claims to have made great strides with how the Mirai drives, with an increase in range and performance, and improved drivability. Toyota had a target of increasing range by 30 per cent, which it says has been achieved by both improved system efficiency and increased hydrogen storage capacity. The inherent advantage of a hydrogen fuel-cell powertrain is its non-reliance on the grid, which so often is the defining aspect of the argument about how clean battery electric vehicles actually are from a well-to-wheel perspective.
