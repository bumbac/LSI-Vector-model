Title: Jaguar F-type R-Dynamic Black revealed – special edition priced from £64,495

Text: Jaguar has revealed its F-type coupe and Roadster in a new special edition trim called R-Dynamic Black. Alongside higher levels of standard equipment and a more luxurious cabin the sports GT, as the name suggests, has gained some new stealthy black trim, too. Prices start from £64,495, a £9530 premium over the base car. Available for both the entry-level P300 four-cylinder and P450 V8, the new special edition has been designed with a suite of new equipment to justify that bump in cost. > Jaguar XJ41 – Dead on arrival Paired with either Santorini Black, Eiger Grey or Firenze Red paint is the black exterior trim package, replacing chrome brightwork around the grille, window surrounds and badging. New split-spoke 20-inch wheels also come as part of the package, painted in gloss black to match. Also standard are the 12-way adjustable Performance seats, wrapped in high-grade Windsor leather in one of two colour schemes, alongside black suedecloth headliner. Unique ‘monogram’ stitching can also be found on the seats and door trims, with the digital instrument cluster surround also finished in suedecloth. There are also illuminated tread plates and satin-finish aluminum shift paddles bundled into the package. As with the range-topping R, the P450 comes equipped with electronically-controlled adaptive dampers with the Adaptive Dynamics system making constant adjustments in order to offer a balance of comfort and stability. Suspension stiffness, steering weight, throttle response and gearshift aggression can also be tweaked by the driver to suit the conditions. The R-Dynamic Black package can be had in either coupe or convertible form on the entry-level P300 or P450 V8, and starts from £64,495.
