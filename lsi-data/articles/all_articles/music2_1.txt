Title: Stream the new album by Carlos Niño & Friends

Text: Following a long journey from music collector to multi-instrumentalist via broadcasting and production work, California based, self-proclaimed “communicator” Carlos Niño is about to release his latest album More Energy Fields, Current. In line with his usual highly collaborative approach – evident through his involvement in co-founding non-profit internet radio station dublab, a long list of co-production credits, plus several projects recording as various duos – the record appears under Niño’s “& Friends” banner, with each track featuring input from a different line up of musicians.  Many of the album's tracks started life as live improvised recordings: “Pleasewakeupalittlefaster, Please...” and “Please Wake Up” are both composed from a live duet recording by Niño and UK saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings from March 2019; “Nightswimming” began as a modular synth recording sent by electronic artist Dntel, which was then reinterpreted by Niño, beat maker Jira >< and pianist Jamael Dean; “Ripples, Reflection, Loop” was constructed from elements of a live recording made during a 2017 European tour with ambient musician Laraaji.  Other tracks started as collective jams, which were subsequently sent on to other artists to interpret and contribute to. “[“Now the background is the foreground”] was a live trio session from my home studio that was later sent to [percussionist and composer] Adam Rudolph for him to add anything he wanted to,” explains Niño. “More Energy Fields, Current is a record of spontaneous composition... depth communication through sound, loops, layers, overdubs and urgency!” More Energy Fields, Current is released by International Anthem as a download on 7 May and in vinyl format on 25 June. Wire subscribers can access a free download of the closing track from the album on The Wire Tapper 55.
