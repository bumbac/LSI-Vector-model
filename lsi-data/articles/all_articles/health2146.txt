Title: The 19 Best Low-Carb Beers That Are Totally Keto-Friendly

Text: There's never an easy time to cut carbs. From summer barbecues to holiday parties and potlucks, your body’s favorite source of energy seems to creep into bottles and bowls wherever you go—for better or worse. But while you're taking your burger off the bun and swapping pasta for every kind of veggie noodle under the sun, know there's one food you don't need to ditch if you're watching your carb count: BEER. 🙏 A typical 12-ounce serving of beer contains anywhere from seven to 14 grams of carbs, according to nutritionist Jessica Perez, RD. But your standard low-carb beer (yes, those do exist!), generally clocks in at somewhere around five grams per serving. But how to find this mythical low-carb beer? You can usually tell a brew is going to be pretty low in carbs if it has the word "light" written anywhere on the label or in the name. Still, double-check the specific carb count to be sure—especially if you’re sticking to a ketogenic diet. (Many light beers include it in the nutrition information facts.) Thankfully, there are plenty of low-carb beers out there that make it totally possible to get into the summer spirit or crack open some freshness year-round, regardless of whether you’re keeping an eye on your macros or simply enjoy the taste of a lighter, more refreshing beer. Whatever you're looking for, these 19 low-carb beers are easy to find and just waiting to be sipped. Cheers! 1.
