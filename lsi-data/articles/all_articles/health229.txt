Title: Dr. Pimple Popper Pops 'Mashed Potatoes' Cheek Cyst In Instagram Video

Text: In Dr. Pimple Popper's new Instagram video, she helped a patient with a giant pimple on the cheek. It was an overstuffed cyst filled with what looked like mashed potatoes. Dr. Pimple Popper used her fingers to squeeze every bit of gunk out of the bump and replayed the extraction in slow motion for a super satisfying clip. It's only Monday but dermatologist Sandra Lee, MD, a.k.a. Dr. Pimple Popper, is already wow-ing her fans. She extracted a piece of "gnocchi" from her patient's pilar cyst and now she's working on another monster cyst. This one is even larger than the pilar cyst, and it's filled with very different gunk. This cyst has been growing on Dr. Pimple Popper's patient's cheek for who knows how long. That's all stopping right here, right now. The dermatologist has a plan to knock it out for good. It's all going down in her latest Instagram video for your viewing pleasure. "Couldn‚Äôt re-cyst squeezing this BIG cheek cyst! ü§è #drpimplepopper #cysts" This content is imported from Instagram.
