Title: GI Show – New Pokémon Snap, MLB The Show 21, And Magic: Legends

Text: On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been digging recently, including New Pokémon Snap, MLB The Show 21, Magic: Legends, Doom: The Ancient Gods, and It Takes Two. Then we take a (mostly) loving look back at the PlayStation Vita, Sony's beloved handheld system, as we reflect on some of our favorite games for the handheld platform. It's a full show, but we make time for another fantastic round of community emails. So please join Brian Shea (@BrianPShea), Dan Tack (@dantack), Alex Stadnik (@Studnik76), Joe Juba (@Joejuba), Liana Ruppert (@DirtyEffinHippy), and Ben Reeves (@Benjaminreeves) for another wild and ever-entertaining episode!
