Title: Chrissy Teigen Shared Her Ultimate Hack for Deep, Painful Spots

Text: There are many things to adore about Chrissy Teigen (like, for example her ingenious clapbacks, or the near-constant hair inspo, or her amazing levels of compassion). But another reason to love and protect her at all costs is her generosity with skincare recommendations - from the face oil she swears by, to breaking down her entire goddamn skincare ritual. The latest reveal she's made is - thank the lord - one for fellow acne sufferers. Chrissy's opened up about her acne in the past, and according to People magazine has now revealed one of her favourite go-to fixes for painful spots: ZitSticka's KILLA kits. ICYMI, ZitSticka KILLA kits comprise 8 SA cleaning swabs, and 8 microdart patches. Applied to clean skin (overnight if you can), these little patches deploy spot-dissolving ingredients into the source of a zit, to help speed up the cycle of the spot, aid healing and reduce inflammation.

As an acne sufferer myself, I feel Chrissy's pain when it comes to acne, and I've tried everything from salicylic acid to DNA hacking to in attempt to clear up monthly cysts. I also agree strongly with her tip-off. My current routine incorporates these stickers along with an SA face wash (I love this by Verso and this by CeraVe) when menstrual spots begin to rear their heads. Oh - and if you're looking for post-spot acne scar hacks, ZitSticka also have you sorted, with their HYPERFADE scar-reducing patches - also now a firm staple on my skincare shelf.
