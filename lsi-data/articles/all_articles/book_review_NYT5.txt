Title: Erin French Dishes About Writing, Survival and Takeout

Text: COOKING A BOOK Erin French wrote her best-selling memoir, “Finding Freedom,” the same way she composes the prix fixe menu for her restaurant: one bite at a time. “My instincts from the kitchen helped me put things down on paper,” said the self-trained chef, who chronicles blossoming as a foodie, her struggle with addiction, the abusive relationship that led to the closing of her first restaurant and her return to her hometown, Freedom, Maine, where she opened The Lost Kitchen. "I’m constantly planning all these dishes, but they have to come together. There’s a beginning, a middle and an end. I’ll sit down and think about flavors, how I want it to taste and feel,” French explained in a phone interview. “When I was writing, it was overwhelming to think about the whole book, so I’d go back to individual moments, one at a time, instead of putting the whole menu out there at once.” She added, “I never even graduated college. There are parts of me that were like, What are you doing? But I needed to get these words down. They came together in the end.”
