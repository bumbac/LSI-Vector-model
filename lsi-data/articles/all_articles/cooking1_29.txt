Title: Sparkling Lemon Balm-Infused Chamomile Tea

Text: Preparation In a medium saucepan, combine the chamomile flowers or tea bags with 2 quarts of water over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer over medium-low heat. Continue to simmer until the liquid is reduced by half, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the heat and set aside. In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, lemon balm leaves, and 1 cup water over medium heat. Cook stirring occasionally until the sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Set aside to cool. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer, reserving the lemon balm leaves. Stir the lemon juice and strained simple syrup to taste into the chamomile tea. Add the reserved lemon balm leaves. Cover and refrigerate until cold. Strain and discard the lemon balm leaves from the tea before serving. Fill tall glasses 2/3 full with the prepared tea and top off with the sparkling water. Add more simple syrup to taste, if desired. Add ice and garnish with a sprig of lemon balm, if using.
