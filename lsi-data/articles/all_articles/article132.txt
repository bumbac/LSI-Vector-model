Title: 'Raya and the Last Dragon' mixes a serious message with its animated action

Text: (CNN) The latest Disney animated adventure can be seen two ways: "Raya and the Last Dragon" offers another bold female lead from an underrepresented group and cute (in one case magical) sidekicks, embarking on a stirring quest. The deeper message, however, involves the toll that division and distrust inflicts on a mythical kingdom, which gives the otherwise pretty-good movie a rather timely hook. Reading too much political subtext into this movie -- which hits theaters in addition to Disney+, like "Mulan," at a premium fee -- won't be a problem for the kids watching it. Yet the adults who join them might find something deeper in the themes, in a film that's otherwise colorful, action-packed, and more than a little convoluted in setting up its premise. Representing Disney animation's first Southeast Asian heroine, the Raya of the title (pronounced "Rye-uh") is as much a warrior as a princess, happily, voiced by Kelly Marie Tran of the recent "Star Wars" movies . She lays out the story in an opening narration, in which dragons fought off a threat 500 years earlier to the mythical kingdom of Kumandra, which subsequently split into five distinct lands. Raya's father (Daniel Dae Kim) remained in possession of a gem that held the last vestiges of the dragons' magic, and dreamed of reuniting the kingdom. But those plans go awry, leaving a dystopian landscape that forces Raya to travel to each of the various lands -- wary as they are of each other -- to reunite the gem and restore harmony to their fractious world. It's a lot to digest, including the dragon of the title, Sisu, voiced with Eddie Murphy-in-"Mulan"-like energy by Awkwafina. The dragon promotes the idea of trusting others, but Raya has a bit of history with the princess of the Fang lands, Namaari ("Crazy Rich Asians'" Gemma Chan), who is every bit her equal in battle.
