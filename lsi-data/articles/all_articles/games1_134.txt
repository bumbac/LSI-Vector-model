Title: GI Show â€“ Mortal Kombat Movie Preview And The Marvel's Avengers Roadmap

Text: On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been digging recently, including The Outer Worlds: Murder On Eridanos, Red Ronin, Devotion, Mundaun, Fights in Tight Spaces, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury. Brian Shea also got an early screening of part of the upcoming Mortal Kombat film, so he shares his thoughts. Next we look back at Crystal Dynamic's Avengers game from last year, talk about its upcoming roadmap, and discuss whether now is finally a good time to return to the game. We're also joined by David L. Craddock (@davidlcraddock), author of books like Stay Awhile and Listen: How Two Blizzards Unleashed Diablo and Forged a Video-Game Empire and the upcoming Monsters in the Dark: The Making of X-COM: UFO Defense. It's a full show, but we make time for another fantastic round of community emails.
