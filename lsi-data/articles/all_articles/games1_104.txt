Title: Chivalry 2 — New Gameplay Today

Text: Are you ready to get rowdy with hundreds of other knights, screaming and yelling before charging into piles of other players? Are you ready to swing your sword with reckless abandon and get hacked in two, ready to respawn moments later? Chivalry 2 is a rambunctious and wild brawlfest that sticks you in the center of the action over and over until your adrenaline cup runneth over, and it does so in the cheeriest fashion as it over-delivers gushing blood and flying limbs. Chivalry 2 is like Monty Python and The Holy Grail met up with Call of Duty for some objective-based action, and it’s coming to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this year. Today, we decided to check out many of the possible moments and scenarios that you could see in any given match in a hot episode of New Gameplay Today! During my time in the alpha, there’s nothing better than charging up a heavy sword swing and chopping up several people in a single blow. Well, except for throwing giant axes and swords at people at close range, that’s a rush. Of course, even those magic moments pale in comparison to beating down enemies with whatever strange non-combat objects are on hand sometimes, like candelabras or chickens. While I gravitated toward the heavy weapon users, archers are also fun to play when you want a break from the endless melee. As an archer, you will likely pepper enemies with little annoyances and also shoot your own team constantly, and have few defenses to fall back on when someone charges you and puts you into melee. That said, it can feel real good to land a headshot on some rampaging berserker that’s cleaving his way through the gates of your castle. I’ve had a ton of fun, dumb fun, in the alpha so far, and I’m looking forward to the full experience. Are you looking forward to Chivalry 2? Does medieval warfare do it for you?
