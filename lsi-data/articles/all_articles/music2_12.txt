Title: Wire mix: 30 years of People Like Us

Text: “Collage makes sense of things in a manner that our brain understands,” says samplist Vicki Bennett aka People Like Us, speaking to Abi Bliss for the cover story of The Wire 447. “Because of these fragmental parts and the way we assemble information, collage is like the working of the brain.”  In the interview, Bennett discusses the influence of Buddhism, the subversion of popular culture and the auto-regenerative nature of cut and paste, as well as her audio-visual multi-screen project Gone, Gone Beyond, which is set to tour the UK and Oslo this year. Here, the prolific artist reflects on 30 years in the field of collage and sampling with a retrospective mix, packed full of solo and collaborative releases and radio works spanning her long career.
