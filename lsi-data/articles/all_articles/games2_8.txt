Title: New on Marvel Unlimited (May 2021): All the comics arriving this month

Text: Over 70 new comics are being added to Marvel Comics' Netflix-style flat-rate digital comics service Marvel Unlimited this May - as well as classics from the House of Ideas' vault. (Image credit: Marvel Comics) For those wanting for complete stories to read all in one sitting, May brings the end of the recent series Shang-Chi, Juggernaut, Werewolf by Night, and Warhammer 40,000: Marneus Calgar to Marvel Unlimited. Several one-shots will also be added this month: Immortal Hulk: Flatline #1, Morbius: Bond of Blood #1, Legend of Shang-Chi #1, Captain Marvel: Marvels Snapshots #1, and Marvel's Voices: Legacy #1. If you're all about the 'new', two new series debut this month on Marvel Unlimited; the mech/superhero mashup Avengers: Mech Strike and the mutant reunion tour series X-Men Legends. Marvel Unlimited's back-catalog surpassed 28,000 comics in 2021, and is available both on the web and on apps for iOS and select Android devices. The service costs $9.99 per month and is accessible with a web browser or via mobile apps for iOS and Android devices.
