Title: GI Show â€“ Resident Evil Village Cover Details And Sitting Down With Supergiant Games

Text: On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, Supergiant Games' Greg Kasavin (@kasavin) joins us to talk about his work on games like Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades. Kasavin also shares his insight into how games are written and why making them is harder than it seems. Then we discuss a handful of the games we've been digging recently, including Outriders, Pac-Man 99, Hades, Oddworld: Soulstorm, Monster Hunter Rise, and The House in Fata Morgana. Of course, we also discuss our recent Resident Evil Village cover story, talk about the game's crafting mechanics, and how Capcom designed the new werewolf-inspired Lycan enemies. Finally, Matthew Haag, A.K.A. Nadeshot (@Nadeshot), joins us to talk about his time playing Call of Duty professionally, his work at 100 Thieves, and his recent partnership with Excedrin helping gamers maintain good head health. It's a full show, but we make time for another fantastic round of community emails.
