Title: GI Show – Star Wars, Indiana Jones, And An Interview With Night School Studio

Text: On this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, we discuss a handful of the games we've been playing recently, including Red Dead Redemption II, Little Nightmares II, Sonic Mania, and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game. We're joined by the co-founders of Night School Studio Adam Hines and Sean Krankel who reflect on their time making games like Oxenfree, Afterparty, and Mr. Robot:1.51exfiltrati0n. It's a full show, but we make time for another fantastic round of community emails where we spend a good deal of time talking about the recent Lucasfilm Games' Indiana Jones and Star Wars announcements. So please join Joe Juba, Jeff Cork, Alex Stadnik, and myself for another wild and ever-entertaining episode! Thanks for listening!
