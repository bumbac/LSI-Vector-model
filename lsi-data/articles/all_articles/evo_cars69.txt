Title: New Toyota GR Supra receives the Liberty Walk treatment

Text: Japan is famed for its wild automotive scene, with drivers modifying cars you’d ordinarily find confined to the walls of a hermetically sealed garage. Liberty Walk is responsible for some of its most extreme creations, and it was only a matter of time before it applied its famous formula to Toyota’s all-new GR Supra. Though it took longer than expected for a kit to emerge, it was most certainly worth the wait. Available in both glassfibre or lightweight carbonfibre, it leaves almost no exterior panel untouched; the bonnet, front splitter, side skirts, wing, diffuser, and of course, arches, have all been pumped to cartoonish levels. > Novitec tunes Ferrari F8 Tributo to 812 Superfast-beating 791bhp If you’d like to opt for the full kit, it’ll set you back $19,030 (approx. £15,200). However, the brand will sell you individual items if that’s a little too much for you. Somewhere in the region of $3000 (approx. £2500) is what each item will cost you, ranging from the front splitter to the mad new rear wing. Airrex air suspension can also be optioned to give you the ultimate stance: yours for $7900 (approx. £6300). Though an equally extreme exhaust system is almost certainly on the cards, there’s no word on powertrain modifications as of yet. Under the bonnet of the standard car is BMW’s B58 3-litre in-line six-cylinder, a unit renowned for its incredible tuning potential, similar to that of the 2JZ from the A80. Some 335bhp and 365lb ft of torque help it go from standstill to 62mph in 4.3sec, going on to a 155mph top speed. Despite its Japanese origins, the kit is available to order in Europe now, with first deliveries scheduled for August. Including the GR Supra’s £54,340 base price, a completed car will cost you around £80,000.
