Title: Michelin launches new Pilot Sport EV tyre

Text: Michelin has announced it will bring a bespoke Pilot Sport EV tyre to the European and North American markets to serve the increasing number of electric vehicles hitting the road. The Michelin Pilot Sport EV has been designed specifically with the distinct attributes – instantaneous torque and high loads – of electric performance cars in mind, promising high grip levels and smooth grip transitions. Michelin has then had to balance this with high noise suppression and low rolling resistance – key priorities for EVs thanks to the lack of engine noise and importance of battery range. The Pilot Sport EV will be initially available in 16 sizes, ranging from the 18 to 22 inches typical of high-end electric performance cars. As a founding partner of Formula E, Michelin has also been able to dip into five years of tyre development alongside the unique racing series, which unlike Formula 1 and other motorsports, has a much closer correlation in terms of size and tread with the tyres on road-going performance cars. Michelin has also announced it will take steps in neutralising the carbon footprint of its new EV tyre range, in part by investing in carbon capturing initiatives to the value of the embodied carbon emitted during production and right through to point of sale at the vendor. The new Michelin Pilot Sport EV range is already available in China, and will be available on vehicles in Europe from the third quarter of 2021.
