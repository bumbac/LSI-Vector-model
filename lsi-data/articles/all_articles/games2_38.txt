Title: Netflix releases first official look at Stranger Things season 4

Text: Netflix has released the first official look at Stranger Things season 4. The minute-long clip sees the test subjects at Hawkins National Laboratory gently going about their day in the ominously titled Rainbow Room. Some are playing on the pachinko machines, while others are engaging in a game of chess. The numbers don't quite add up, though. Namely, a certain Eleven is missing from this flashback scene. Then, we can hear the voice of what appears to be Matthew Modine's Dr. Brenner, the one-time director of Hawkins Lab in Indiana. He greets the children in typically skin-crawling fashion as we hear Eleven's labored breathing emanating from her own room. Finally, Brenner asks a question: "Eleven, are you listening?" She may not be focused, but Netflix certainly has our attention. The trip back in time to a few years prior to the events of Stranger Things has everything we want from the fourth season: it's dark, cryptic, and is seemingly set to dive into the deeper lore of just what's going on in the Hoosier State. Stranger Things’ young stars have also recently teased the upcoming season. Gaten Matarazzo, who plays Dustin, has called season 4 the "scariest" season yet. While Mike’s actor, Finn Wolfhard, expects the show to drop in 2022. No release date as of writing, but it's nice to know we'll be back in Hawkins (and diving into Eleven's past) sooner rather than later. While we wait, check out the best Netflix shows.
