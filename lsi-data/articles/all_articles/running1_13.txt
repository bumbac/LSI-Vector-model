Title: Lightweight Jackets for Running

Text: More fashionable than a poncho but not as heavy-duty as a raincoat, a lightweight jacket is an essential item to have in your arsenal of outerwear—even after traditional jacket season has come to an end. A water-resistant and windproof shell will make running tolerable during unpredictable spring and fall weather, and even the occasional brisk summer morning. What makes these jackets indispensable is their overall lightness and packability. Each of them packs down into a zipper pocket, making them fit into the tiniest corners of your gym bag or running backpack, and some can even be worn around your wrist or as a mini-backpack mid-run. These jackets were vetted by 50-plus local wear-testers, who wore them on runs and evaluated them on their fit, breathability, and resistance to wind and rain. → For a more comprehensive guide that includes rain jacket terminology, permeability testing, and testers’ comments, head to The Best Rain Jackets for Runners.
