Title: Alpina Deko Set decals - Art of Speed

Text: Innately right on most Americana, the racing stripe is a rare thing indeed in the world of European road cars. In fact only very special models from the likes of Renault and Ferrari are brazen enough to flaunt something so jazzy. Bucking the trend is Alpina, which has offered racing stripes on every one of its BMW conversions since 1974. Known simply as the ‘Deko Set’, these unusually sophisticated decals underline Alpina’s modern-day role as understated antidote to the BMW M-car and are an elegant strand of the brand’s DNA. Their genesis was in the mid-’70s, when Alpina began asking customers whether they’d like to give their car a ‘new identity’ and a ‘sporty appearance’. If so, rhombic designs were applied to the flanks of the car – then perhaps a modified Neue Klasse BMW, or a 2002 or CS – in colour schemes often derived from successful BMW Alpina race cars, on which the graphics first sprouted. Green, for instance, emerged on the demonic Gösser Beer 3.5 CSL. Previously only the script ‘BMW ALPINA’ had been available – on the front wings and usually in silver or black. Either way, it could all be easily removed if the novelty somehow wore off.
