Title: Listen to an exclusive recording by Kikimore

Text: “There’s a complete freedom in building your instrument,” says synth building and performance collective Kikimore founding member Barbara Poček, speaking to Abi Bliss in The Wire 444, “The way you connect the wires, how you play with the breadboard, the circuits, it’s your own domain. There’s no way you can fuck this up; no rules on how to play it.”  The Ljubljana based group first met in the mid-2010s as participants of a series of workshops, after which they were encouraged to keep converging for further sessions by the organisers of local initiative ČIPke. Kikimore eventually also began to perform together and released their debut album Sigil in November 2020. This previously unreleased track “Viia” (mixed and mastered by Luka Seliškar) has been adapted from a rehearsal recording which took place before Amro festival in May 2020.
