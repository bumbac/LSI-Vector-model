Title: New Alpina B3 saloon joins Touring in Tokyo

Text: Alpina has revealed the saloon version of its new B3, after showing off the Touring earlier this year at the Frankfurt motor show. Mechanically identical to the Touring, the main difference, aside from the obvious body style change, is an even more impressive set of performance figures thanks to a slightly lower weight and centre of gravity. As such, the new Alpina B3 saloon is able to hit 62mph in 3.8sec, and 124mph in 13.4sec, 0.1sec and 0.5sec faster than the Touring respectively. Its top speed has also increased to 187mph, 1mph faster than the Touring. Generating all of this performance is a 3-litre twin-turbocharged inline-six petrol engine producing 455bhp between 5000 and 7000rpm, with a chunky 516lb ft of torque filling out the lower part of the rev range between 3000 and 4250rpm. Alpina says the B3’s power comes from an ‘S58’-designation engine, which is in fact the very unit that will power next year’s M3, and already powers the X3 and X4 Ms. Whereas classically the Alpina derivative has worked from the most powerful non-M division powertrain of that model for its cars, this appears to no longer apply with the new B3, making it closer than ever to BMW’s own incoming 3-series performance flagship.
