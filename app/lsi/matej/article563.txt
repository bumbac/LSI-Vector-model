Title: Lululemon Restocked Its Sale Section — And It's Looking *Really* Good Right Now

Text: Already falling short of your 2021 fitness goals? (It's okay, you're not alone.) If you want to stay motivated during this dark, cold winter, why not pick up some new workout clothes? I can't back it up with science just yet, but I'm pretty convinced wearing cute workout gear can single-handedly motivate you to go the extra mile. If you want to stock up on sports bras, moisture-wicking tops, and leggings—but don't want to blow your budget—Lululemon just restocked its "We Made Too Much" section. You see, when the retailer produces too much of an item and wants to make room for new inventory, they offer steep discounts on their extra stock. Whether you want to replenish your activewear rotation or invest in some WFH essentials, now's a better time than any to do so. But hurry! Sizes and colors are selling out fast. Go ahead, shop these epic deals before they're gone for good.
