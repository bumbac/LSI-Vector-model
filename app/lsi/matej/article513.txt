Title: 12 Best Comfortable Wedding Shoes, According To Podiatrists

Text: When it comes to wedding attire, a comfortable pair of shoes is absolutely essential—whether you're the one getting hitched or the one leading the "Cha Cha Slide." After all, you’ve got to make it from the ceremony to the reception to the inevitable afterparty—all on your feet. Oh, and not to mention, hours of standing in front of the camera. And while you might be tempted to wear flats instead of heels to spare your tootsies from post-wedding agony (and about a dozen blisters), that's actually not the best idea, says Miguel Cunha, MD, podiatrist and founder of NYC-based Gotham Footcare. Completely flat shoes, he says, might mess with the arch in your foot, leading to heel pain, shin splints, and knee or back pain. Instead, look for a shoe with a 1- to 3-inch heel and built-in arch support for maximum comfort and staying power, says Dr. Cunha. From kitten heels to slides to wedges, these 12 comfortable wedding shoes have it all.
