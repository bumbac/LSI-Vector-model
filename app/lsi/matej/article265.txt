Title: 750bhp Time Attack Nissan 370Z shown at SEMA

Text: It seems Japanese manufacturers have thrown everything at this year’s SEMA show, with Toyota bringing a handful of Supra concepts and Nissan displaying this, a 750bhp Time Attack 370Z. The one-off model is set to compete in the 2020 racing season, and has been developed in conjunction with US-based Z1 Motorsports. As with any car built for the series, it’s clear that this is no ordinary racer, featuring a rather substantial rear wing, a significantly wider track, and less than standard bodywork. Created by Nismo itself, the project began with a stripped-down, acid-dipped 370Z Nismo body, upon which a custom carbonfibre aerodynamics package was added, complete with a 3D-printed front splitter, rear diffuser and side skirts. > Nissan 370Z replacement spied testing Being a Time Attack weapon, the model’s standard 3.7-litre V6 was completely overhauled, with the addition of dual Garrett GTX3076 turbochargers, a new fuel management system and a Z1 Motorsports exhaust helping it reach an output of around 750bhp. Nismo also provided uprated oil, transmission and differential cooling systems to help keep everything under control. Power is sent to the rear wheels through a six-speed sequential transmission, a Nismo differential and sticky Yokohama Advan A052 315-section tyres. Nismo is solely responsible for the kinematics, fitting new front upper control arms, rear camber arms, traction rods and more. Even components from the R35 GT-R make an appearance, such as the front knuckle conversion, hubs and the Brembo braking system (390mm front, 380 rear), sitting behind the RAYS Volk ZE40 18-inch wheels. Inside, everything is geared towards weight savings and competition, with only a single OMP FIA-approved bucket seat included, alongside a full roll-cage, custom-fabricated instrument panel, quick release steering wheel and a Nismo six-point harness. The model will go into action in next year’s Time Attack series.
