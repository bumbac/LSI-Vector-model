Title: Mysterious Toyota GR Yaris spied testing at the Nürburgring

Text: First deliveries of the new Toyota GR Yaris hot hatch are set to commence before the end of the year, but our spy photographers have already snapped a curious variant testing at the Nürburgring. Though it shares the same bodywork as the production GR Yaris, there are a number of new aerodynamic components that point towards a possible increase in performance and capability derived for on-road or perhaps competition applications. At the front are a set of canards that increase downforce on the front-axle, while new vents can now be seen on the front wings that relieve air pressure in the front arches. > 2020 ​Toyota GR Yaris to make UK debut this week The new rear wing is the most notable addition, larger in size than most on any car of its class – and joins what looks like an air-flow reader that’s placed in the centrepoint of the rear bumper, pointing towards some form of under-body modifications that could clean up the under-body aero. What lies under the bonnet is unknown, but it’s likely to share its 257bhp 1.6-litre turbocharged three-cylinder, which gets the standard GR Yaris from standstill to 62mph in 5.5sec and onto a 143mph top speed. As the GR Yaris is a homologation special, this test mule could be an even more specialised road-going model, or rather something like a customer tarmac-specification rally variant for privateer teams across Group R, Group N or Super 1600 rally classes. Time will tell as development continues.
