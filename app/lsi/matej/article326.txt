Title: Craig Breen's amazing on-board from the Circuit of Ireland rally

Text: You won’t see a finer piece of on-board footage from the weekend’s motorsport than this. Tackling the magnificent Glens stage on the Circuit of Ireland, rally winner Craig Breen is mesmerizingly fast to watch as he skilfully guides his DS3 R5 down the narrow strip of tarmac. The rally was the second round of the reinvigorated British Rally Championship and there was drama right from the start, with Keith Cronin hitting a bank within seconds of entering the first stage. Championship leader Elfyn Evans had a lead of 12 seconds after the first two stages, but a mechanical for his Fiesta R5 put paid to his hopes. He ceded the lead to Irishman Craig Breen who won the event last year. Irishman Breen, who had an impressive WRC debut in Sweden this year, was pushed all the way by the pole Kajetan Kajetanowicz, but eventually won by 10 seconds, with Alastair Fisher in third. The 27 year-old from Waterford set up the win on the rally’s 19mile signature stage, the Glens, with a run that was a huge 24 seconds faster than anyone else. He had targeted the stage before the rally, saying that it was one of the best roads for rallying anywhere in the world. After watching the footage we can see what he means.
