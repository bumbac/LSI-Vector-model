Title: The 45 Best Mother's Day Brunch And Breakfast Recipes

Text: Sure, you could get you mom flowers or a facial for Mother's Day, but what better way to celebrate your leading lady than with every gal's all-time favorite meal: BRUNCH. I mean, nothing says "I love you, mom" like cannellini bean shakshuka, goat cheese crostinis, and one too many mimosas, amiright? If Mother's Day brunch isn't already a tradition for you, it's about to be. If you're not brimming with healthy ideas, though, don't sweat it. All you need is a balance of sweet and savory eats, plus a little protein to keep you satisfied and ready to keep celebrating mom all day long. When it comes to sweets, opt for anything from yogurt parfaits with fruit and granola to waffles and pancakes, says Joseph Rizza, executive chef at Chicago's Prime & Provisions. For a little something savory, you can't go wrong with classic eggs Benedict or crispy potatoes. Finger foods are always a safe bet, too. Didier Durand, executive chef of Chicago's Marchesa, loves topping little brioche toasts with avocado, microgreens, and something rich like Foie Gras. Fancy, right? Turns out, you don't have to know how to use one of those cool kitchen blow torches to pull this off. And though your eats may be the stars of the show (aside from your mom, of course), feel free to rinse everything down with peach bellinis or flavorful Bloody Maries. Pro tip: Add a little horseradish and a splash of pickle juice to your Bloodies for extra heat and brine, Rizza suggests. Select your menu from one of the following healthy Mother's Day brunch ideas and you're sure to impressâ€”and without leaving your favorite lady in a complete food coma.
