The UC and CSU systems, with 33 campuses across the state, said the requirement would kick in once the FDA has fully approved at least one vaccine and that adequate supplies of the shots are available. As of now, coronavirus vaccines in the US are being distributed under FDA approval for emergency use. The plan was reported earlier Thursday by the Los Angeles Times. "Receiving a vaccine for the virus that causes COVID-19 is a key step people can take to protect themselves, their friends and family, and our campus communities while helping bring the pandemic to an end," said UC President Michael V. Drake, a physician.

UC and CSU appear to be the first state-wide systems with this requirement, following dozens of private universities like Yale, Georgetown, Princeton, Dartmouth, Columbia, Cornell and New York University.
