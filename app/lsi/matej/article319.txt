Title: Citroen C3 Aircross - quirky Juke rival priced from £13,995

Text: Citroen is throwing its hat into the Nissan Juke ring with the new C3 Aircross, a compact SUV that continues with Citroen's recent revitalisation of its design and engineering-led roots. Not that a small SUV is a particularly original idea, nor is it likely to feature alongside some of André Lefèbvre or Flaminio Bertoni's works in the more fondly-remembered sections of Citroen's history, but small SUVs are big business, and if we're to have them at all then they might as well be interesting. > Citroen C3 review - Supermini sets new standards for comfort, but is it fun? The C3 Aircross is certainly that, following on from the C4 Cactus and more recent C3 supermini with styling that suggests it's somewhere between automobile and modern kitchenware. It goes on sale in November with pricing starting at £13,995. It follows on closely from the C-Aircross concept revealed earlier this year in Geneva, with a stubby bonnet, high-set LED daytime running lights in a wide grille bar, and lower, separate main light units. Its floorpan sits 20mm further from the road than the regular C3 - probably not enough to cross the Darién Gap, but perhaps a little more suitable for kerb-hopping - while tough-looking plastic wheelarch and sill extensions lend it the obligatory toughened-up look. Customers will then be able to personalise their Aircross with eight different body colours, four roof hues, four colour packs and a selection of different wheel options, for 90 different exterior combinations.
