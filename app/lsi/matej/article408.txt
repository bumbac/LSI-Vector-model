So many celebrities say switching up their workouts is the key to getting results, so when she decides to skip the elliptical, she pole dances, which also activates her core. “Sometimes doing the same workouts or working out in the same places becomes a lil boring/ repetitious for me so I had to spice it up a little bit and take a pole class," she captioned an Instagram video showing her pole dance workout. "This sh*t kicked my a** but I’m definitely going back ! What are somethings y’all do to keep the work out interesting ?" This content is imported from Instagram.

Megan shared in an IGTV video that she now has a pre-workout smoothie that includes bananas, greens, and blueberries. A little more knowledge she dropped in the video: She’s lost 10 pounds. "It’s not to late to start the month off right !!!" she wrote in the caption. "It’s week 3 and I can see/ feel a real difference in my body 😭 Booty sitting high 🐎 DONT GET DISCOURAGED HOTTIES START YOUR BOOT CAMP BEFORE THEE WEEK IS OVER ! #hottiebootcamp."
