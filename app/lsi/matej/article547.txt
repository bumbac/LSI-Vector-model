Title: Healthy Saut√©ed Chickpeas and Spaghetti Squash Recipe

Text: 1. Using a large serrated knife, halve spaghetti squash lengthwise; discard seeds. Place both halves cut-side down on a large piece of parchment paper and microwave on high until just tender, 9 to11 minutes. Use a fork to shred squash strands, and transfer to a large bowl. 2. In a bowl, toss onion, lemon juice, and a pinch each salt and pepper. Heat 1 Tbsp oil and garlic in a large nonstick skillet on medium. Add chickpeas and sumac, and cook, tossing 2 minutes. 3. Toss spaghetti squash with chickpea mixture and remaining Tbsp oil and 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper. Fold in parsley and onion (and juices). Top with feta.
