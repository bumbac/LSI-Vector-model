Title: Prince Harry And Meghan Markle's Interview Body Language Decoded

Text: All those questions you had about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's decision to take a step back from their duties as senior royals? Oprah asked them for you. During her two-hour tell-all interview with the couple last night on CBS, she dug deep and asked about the supposed feuds between Meghan and Kate Middleton; Harry and his brother, William; the couple's relationship with Queen Elizabeth; racism; mental health; their children; and finances. No question seemed to be off-limits. And, in response, Meghan and Harry cleared up much of the speculation. They opened up about how it is they went from blissfully married royals to living on their own in L.A. in just three years—and all of the struggles they had to quietly endure. In order to protect the reputations of family and palace officials, there were a few times during the interview when the couple provided vague answers. But that doesn’t mean they didn’t reveal a thing or two by way of body language. "Meghan’s overall body language was filled with poise and precision," says Karen Donaldson, a body language expert. "We saw it in the way she often looked away and upwards as she answered Oprah's questions." She was never defensive and always confident—something made clear by the way she rarely broke eye contact with Oprah as she gave her responses. As for Harry, Donaldson says he shifted from being tense to protective and back again throughout the interview. The conversation was loaded with lots of revelations, and yet, there's still more to unpack. Ahead, Donaldson reveals everything else the couple communicated—just non-verbally.
