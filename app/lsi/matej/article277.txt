Title: Nissan IMx revealed – autonomous electric SUV a look into Nissan's future

Text: Nissan was one of the first global automakers to put a full battery-electric vehicle in the market, but it’s been slower than some to expand that expertise into other market segments. This year’s Tokyo motor show suggests that’s all about to change, with the second-generation Nissan Leaf making its debut, alongside a Nismo-prepared variant and this – the IMx concept. > Click here for our drive of the new Nissan Leaf While not yet confirmed for production, the IMx concept hints at a future long-range fully-electric and fully-autonomous crossover – able to travel 373 miles on a full charge. This range is backed up by what Nissan calls ProPilot, a fully-autonomous driving mode that can handle entire journeys unassisted. As part of these functions, the concept could drop its passengers off at a location of their choice, and head off on its own to park and recharge. As is becoming more common with this type of vehicle (and particularly among concepts), it would also have the ability to deliver electricity back to the grid, if it wasn’t needed imminently by the driver. Such functions would also be available at the owner’s home, able to supply power to a house should the local grid fail for any reason.
