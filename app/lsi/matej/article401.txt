Title: Dr. Pimple Popper Pops 'Narwhal' Horn Blackhead In New Youtube Video

Text: In Dr. Pimple Popper's new Youtube video, she helped a patient with giant blackheads. The dermatologist called them "narwhal" blackheads while extracting the juicy pimples. Dr. Pimple Popper used her comedone extractor tool to push out a long horn. When dermatologist Sandra Lee, MD, a.k.a. Dr. Pimple Popper, is extracting, you never know what might pop out. It could be a whole meal of pasta steatocystomas with some lipoma chicken cutlets, or a host of different creepy crawly bugs. She seems a bit magical at times, and that's very true in her latest Youtube video. Dr. Pimple Popper gave a sneak peek on her Instagram account. Her patient came in with a unique case of blackheads. There are tons of clogged pores and even more gunk stuffed under the surface in each one. Dr. Pimple Popper described the extraction process in the caption: "‘The Blackhead Narwhal’ is up on YouTube now❗️These forehead extractions were 💯!
