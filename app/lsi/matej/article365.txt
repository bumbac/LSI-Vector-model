Title: This Vibrator Shook Me Out of My Orgasm Drought

Text: As for its design, the palm-sized toy is as sleek as it is user-friendly. Its body-safe silicone is smooth to the touch, and it's lightweight enough to comfortably position where you need it angled. It has only two buttons: one you press to turn it on and another to scan through six different tapping patterns until you find your sweet spot. While I wouldn't describe its noise level as whisper-quiet, it's still discreet enough to use without the neighbors of your shared wall thinking you're taking on a DIY renovation.
