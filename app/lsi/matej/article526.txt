Title: Your April 2021 Sex Horoscope

Text: You’ve got a solid, sexy month ahead. Are you ready for it? Venus is hanging out in Aries for the first half of the month, making you laser-focused on getting what you want in bed. The full moon on the 26th is also super-sensual for you. Intense stuff is going to be happening between you and your S.O.—mentally and physically. You’ll feel some serious passion happening between you two and, heads up: There might be a teensy bit of jealousy in the mix, too. (Try to resist the urge to peruse your partner’s phone: It never goes anywhere good.) In between all that passion, you might say a thing or two you regret. It’s not relationship-ending stuff, but maybe think now about the best way to respond if your S.O. asks what you really think of their mom. Here's what else is in store for you this month, according to Donna Page, a professional astrologer with a graduate degree in counseling psychology.
