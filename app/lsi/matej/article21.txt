Title: What Made Our Species Unique: Walking

Text: FIRST STEPS How Upright Walking Made Us Human By Jeremy DeSilva Walking: We marvel when other animals get up on their hind legs and do it, applaud our children when they master it, but most of the time blithely ignore how remarkable a feat it really is. Yet moving bipedally (on two legs) has proved fiendishly tricky to explain from an evolutionary perspective. Enter “First Steps,” by the paleoanthropologist Jeremy DeSilva, a book that strides confidently across this complex terrain, laying out what we know about how walking works, who started doing it and when. DeSilva proposes that our bipedalism is at the root of our uniqueness as a species, and the book is carefully structured, neatly braiding his own research with the wider narrative and history of human evolution. One chapter opens, for example, with a vista of wind-whistled acacia trees at Laetoli, Tanzania, a landscape famed for its preserved trails of animal and hominin footprints made some 3.66 million years ago. But before going back in time to fully explore this scene of desolation — a group of australopithecines squelching their way through soggy volcanic ash — he sets the scene in 2019, with a little girl and her thorn-spiked foot. DeSilva’s team encounters her while discovering new tracks, and uses the gory account — featuring “an ungodly amount of pus” — to help us consider the vulnerability as well as the benefits of being bipedal creatures.
