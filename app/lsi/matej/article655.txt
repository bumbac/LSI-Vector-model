Title: Name Your Price for This Complete Python Masterclass Bundle

Text: Writing code used to look like wizardry to those on the outside, and drudgery to those actually doing it. A lot of that was down to the syntax and the obscure rules required to get code to run in these classic programming languages. Guido van Rossum changed all that when he designed Python. Python is in the top three programming languages used today. The syntax is intuitive and easy to decipher for beginners, but experienced programmers can create complex software with it. If you want a job in nearly any corner of the tech sector, Python is definitely worth learning. The Advanced Python Masterclass & Automation Training Bundle is more than just a good starting point for anyone who's serious about pursuing a career as a programmer. This series of 14 online courses takes learners from the very basics of Python to the creation of advanced data structures. You'll find more than enough training here to start a career in any field from web development to data analytics, but the real focus is on Python's ability to automate complex tasks. Once you've got the basics down, there are hands-on courses that show you how to incorporate your code with platforms like GitHub or Django. Along the way, you'll build working bots and apps like a web scraper and cryptocurrency portfolio tool. The Advanced Python Masterclass & Automation Training Bundle includes nearly 80 hours of content, and the best part is that PCMag readers can now get it for (potentially) pennies. The "pay what you want" deal means you can name your price and see how it compares with the average amount offered. Bid higher than that and you'll take home all 14 courses. And even if you bid lower, you'll "still take home something great." If you beat the leader's price you'll get entered into an epic giveaway. Prices are subject to change.
