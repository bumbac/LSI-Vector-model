Title: 15 Ways To Boost Energy At 3 P.M. Without Caffeine

Text: Picture this: After a long, productive morning, you have lunch and you feel ready to take on the afternoon by finishing the rest of the tasks on your to-do list...until, out of nowhere, the 3 p.m. slump hits hard.

The following science-backed tips will help you get through the rest of the day without that jittery feeling later on.
