Title: High performance Volkswagen ID GTX models on their way

Text: Volkswagen has confirmed that it will soon reveal high-performance additions to its electric ID range, starting with a version of the ID.4 SUV at the end of this month. To denote this new performance agenda, the cars in question will wear the GTX badge, aligning them with the GTI, GTE and GTD models found in VW’s traditional line-up. VW has also revealed that all GTX models will feature all-wheel drive, suggesting the addition of a second electric motor on the front axle in addition to the rear-mounted motors in the current ID.3 and ID.4. Until recently, all models on the MEB platform, on which the ID range is based, have been powered exclusively by this layout. But that all changed with Audi’s debut of its first MEB-based car, the Q4 e-tron, which will arrive with a high-specification quattro version that offers a clue to what VW has coming. For context, the Audi Q4 e-tron 50 quattro produces a peak power figure of 295bhp, which is a 91bhp lift over the most potent ID.4 with the 77kWh battery pack. The Audi accelerates to 62mph in just 6.5sec, 2sec quicker than the VW, and gives us a good idea of what to expect when the hot ID.4 is revealed. While it’s impossible at this point to say whether this first GTX will share identical figures to the Audi, we suspect that given Volkswagen’s performance angle it will feature a subtle increase in power, plus some chassis and styling updates. Unfortunately, the chances of seeing a smaller and marginally lighter ID.3 GTX is less certain due to packaging and pricing limitations, so the wait will continue to see who will throw down the gauntlet of designing and marketing the first true electric hot hatchback.
