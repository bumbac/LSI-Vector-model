Title: 21 Women Share Their Favorite Mother's Day Memories

Text: 'I gave birth to my third son on Mother's Day.' “My favorite Mother’s Day memory was May 9th, 2010. I was nine months pregnant with my third child and, with two other young boys, ages 1 and 3, I was already exhausted and sleep deprived. My request for my Mother’s Day gift was a full night’s sleep, so my husband agreed to be on the night shift so I could sleep through the night. "Close to 11 p.m., I woke up to a soaking wet bed. I sat wearily up and realized my water had broken. I did what any sensible soon-to-be mother of three would do: I frantically stripped the bed, started the wash, grabbed the clean clothes out of the dryer, woke up my husband and said, ‘Quick help me fold the laundry! My water broke! I’m not leaving until the laundry’s done and the house is clean, dammit!’ "An hour later, we headed to the hospital, me alternately screaming and laughing and complaining about my ‘one night of sleep’ being interrupted. As soon as the epidural was in place, I promptly fell soundly asleep on the operating table. The nurse kept shaking my shoulder to wake me up, saying, ‘Honey, your baby’s going to be out any minute, you’re not going to want to miss it!’ When I heard, ‘It’s a boy!’ I yelled, ‘Are you sure??’ and everyone laughed. I fell in love five seconds later with son #3. Best Mother’s Day ever.” —Kristjana Cook, Annapolis, MD
