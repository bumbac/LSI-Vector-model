Title: Turn Mind Maps Into Action Plans With This Discounted Tool

Text: Why do projects fail? There can be any number of reasons, especially if those projects require the cooperation of a large team. One thing is for certain, though, if that team can't visualize how to get to the goal, they're doomed to fail. This can be true even of small self-improvement projects we assign ourselves, which is why mind maps are just as useful in the home office as in the boardroom. They provide a visual representation of exactly what's in the team leader's head, so everyone involved starts off with the same vision. Those who remember the "traditional" office environment might consider mind maps just scribbles on whiteboards, but MindMaster Mind Mapping Software gives the diagram a much-needed update, making it a dynamic focal point on which teams can collaborate. Business and finance sites love this app, and it's easy to see why once you actually start working with it. The interface makes the act of creating a mind map not just easy but fun, with more than 700 clip art "stickers" you can add to your creation. Choose from a gallery of basic structures and themes, then customize it with shapes and a color scheme that fits your company's brand. Once you've completed your map, you can export it to PowerPoint as part of a stunning presentation. Brainstorming Mode can be used to turn the map into a collaborative "shooting gallery" of ideas; you can even view it as a Gantt chart and turn those map nodes into action items that you'll track as they progress.
