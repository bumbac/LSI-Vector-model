Title: Our Favourites: Three Bookshops in China

Text: a mirrored bookshop in Guiyang, a book experience consisting of four differently designed areas in Suzhou and the Enclave Book Shop in NanTou.  Beyond Imagination: Bookshop by X+Living  It is one of many branches for the bookseller Zhongshuge that the office X+Living has designed in recent years. Winding aisles and shelves that seem to pile up endlessly offer customers a shopping experience that online retail cannot. In addition, the spaces explicitly invite customers to wander and linger.
