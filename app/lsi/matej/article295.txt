Title: Porsche collection of dreams stars in RM Sotheby’s February sale

Text: We’ve seen incredible cars pass through RM Sotheby’s auctions over the years, and this month’s sale is no different. Highlighting RM’s February sale is a seven-car Porsche collection, featuring some of the marque’s most exclusive models in equally exclusive specs. The collection starts with a non-Weissach 918 Spyder finished in a £45,000 Liquid Chrome Blue paint finish, and equipped with the same magnesium wheels from the Weissach package, and a Mocha brown leather interior. Though only 3400 miles have been covered since it was delivered, it’s expected to sell for under £900,000. > New 992 Porsche 911 GT3 revealed – a McLaren 600LT killer Its predecessor, a Porsche Carrera GT from exactly a decade earlier, is also on offer. Painted in striking Fayence Yellow, despite the collection spending most of its time in Switzerland, this particular example is US-spec and is estimated to go for between £600,000 and £650,000. At the other end of the scale is a 1995 993 Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet, one of just 14 examples produced worldwide. This particular car is believed to have been commissioned by Michael Schumacher’s long-time manager, Willi Weber, and was optioned with black paintwork, black wheels and a matching black interior. It comes equipped with an unusual semi-automatic gearbox sourced from RUF and installed by Porsche Exclusive, eliminating the need for a clutch pedal. It has under 20,000 miles on the odometer, and due to its rarity is expected to go for up to £700,000. The newest model in the collection is a 2018 GT2 RS, and like the rest of the cars on offer, comes with its own distinctive specification. Ordered from the factory in Ferrari’s Azzurro California blue via the Porsche PTS service, it also does without the standard rear wing to give it a more subtle appearance – but will be included should you want to make use of the downforce it provides, though. The collection also features a 997-generation GT2 RS car in Carrera white. Both examples are expected to sell for up to £350,000 each. Last but most certainly not least are two more modern classics, the 911 R and 997 Sport Classic. Though the GT3 Touring dampened the buzz, the 911 R is still one of the finest 911s of all time. The vast majority are finished in neutral shades, but this owner forked out for paint-to-sample Gulf Blue, with brown leather and a number of CXX custom options to be found inside. Sitting alongside it is the 911 Sport Classic, the 12th of only 250 built, finished in grey with an Espresso Brown leather interior. All lots are set to close on Sunday February 28th, so if anything’s caught your eye, it’s time to prime your wallet...
