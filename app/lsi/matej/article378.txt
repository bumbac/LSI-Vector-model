Title: Dr. Pimple Popper Pops 'Donut Filling' Steatocystoma On Instagram

Text: In Dr. Pimple Popper's new Instagram video, she squeezes a satisfying steatocystoma. This bump was stuffed with an oily, yellow liquid, which fans compared to donut filling. When Dr. Pimple Popper squeezed, all the gunk came spilling out. Some pimples get all the attention. Yep, I'm talking about blackheads. But, even the diehard blackhead popping fans should give credit to the satisfying extractions that come from steatocystomas. Dermatologist Sandra Lee, MD, a.k.a. Dr. Pimple Popper, certainly gives love and effort to these oily pops. One particularly entertaining steatocystoma is the star of her latest Instagram video. Dr. Pimple Popper introduces it in the caption: "Steatocystomas üíõ (Cysts of the Sebaceous Gland)" And, she dives into some helpful background info for all her fans: "The contents of steatocystomas are more liquid and odorless, often clear or slightly yellow in color. These types of cysts are benign and rare (despite seeing so many in my videos) especially compared to epidermoid cysts. Treatment isn‚Äôt necessary, but may seek removal due to appearance AND they give us #popaholics a nice SQUEEZE! üí•ü§è #drpimplepopper #steatocystoma" This content is imported from Instagram.

She begins by numbing the area before getting her fingers ready to squeeze. Once she applies pressure, a ton of oily gunk starts to pile up on the top of the skin.
