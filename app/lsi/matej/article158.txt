How to get your copy of evo Inside issue 285 of evo Celebrating the Lotus Elise and the cars it has inspired, getting a first taste of what could be the next hot hatch benchmark, and finding an answer to the perennial question ‘auto or manual?’ – all this and a whole lot more can be found in evo issue 285, which is available now in store and also online at magsdirect.co.uk. In its 25-year production run, the Elise has had a significant impact on the very fabric of performance car development. It introduced not only new technology but also a philosophy that has since underpinned some of the greatest performance cars of the last quarter-century. So with the groundbreaking Lotus’s retirement now imminent, the evo team has tested the long-running British sports car in its final form, while bringing along some of the models from other marques that it has influenced along the way. evo 285 also sees our introduction to what might become the next hot hatch icon. Hyundai has already wowed us with its i30 N, and now the smaller i20 N promises to take the lessons learnt from the company’s first full-scale hot hatch operation and package them into a lighter and more agile package. Does it hit the mark? A thorough road test reveals all.
