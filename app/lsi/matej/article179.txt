Title: Alpina B5 Bi-Turbo Edition 50

Text: 50 years on from the performance specialists’ first car, Alpina will produce a special edition version of its B5 Bi-Turbo. Called the Edition 50, just 50 cars will be produced with an increased output of 592bhp. This represents a substantial growth of 92bhp compared with the standard B5, making the Edition 50 Alpina’s most powerful production car ever. Torque also grows to 590lb ft, helping to shorten the 0-62mph sprint to just 4.2sec (five tenths less than standard). Top speed grows from 191mph to 204mph. Power is sent rearwards through an eight-speed Switch-Tronic and limited-slip diff, and comes from the same BMW 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 as the standard B5. In the Edition 50 however, further fettling and the fitment of more effective turbos helps to deliver up to 1.2 bar of pressure. Intakes have been shortened to sharpen throttle response, with Alpina also uprating the intercoolers – one air-cooled, two water-cooled. Other modifications include lightened pistons and adjusted mapping. Weight has been trimmed in the Edition 50, with new wheels shedding a substantial 15.6kg of unsprung mass (7.6kg from the front pair and 8kg from the rear). This impressive saving has largely come thanks to the switch from cast to forged aluminium manufacturing. A further 17kg has been saved with the fitment of an Acrapovic developed titanium exhaust that also helps to reduce back-pressure. The Edition 50 gains new body trim and bespoke interior trim to confirm its limited edition status. The car will be available in either Alpina Green or Alpina Blue, while a bespoke Edition 50 Sepia is also available with BMW Individual. An unconfirmed ‘small number’ of cars will reach the UK, with prices starting at £86,850. This is just shy of £15,000 more than the standard car.
