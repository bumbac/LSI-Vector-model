Text: World Soccer Gossip: Jesse Lingard Latest April 21, 2021 Here’s your daily round-up of transfer gossip from World Soccer. JESSE LINGARD LATEST It’s no surprise that West Ham United are so keen on keeping Manchester United loanee Jesse Lingard beyond the end of the season, given how well he’s performed at the London Stadium in 2021. However, it’s beginning to look like they’re going to face some stern competition for his signature if they are serious about landing him on a permanent basis. According to Football Insider, Aston Villa are considering making a move for the 28-year-old in the summer, and they proved last year that they don’t lack ambition in the transfer market. MOURINHO CONCERNS One story which was overshadowed by the European Super League announcement earlier this week was Tottenham Hotspur’s decision to sack Jose Mourinho. According to Eurosport, the club’s chairman Daniel Levy was concerned that key players would leave in the summer unless he made a managerial change, including Harry Kane, Dele Alli and Gareth Bale. REAL BETIS INTERESTED IN ERIC BAILLY One area that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is likely to want to improve in this summer’s transfer market is his defence. However, The Red Devils will need to offload a few of their fringe players to help make room for some new arrivals. According to The Sun, Real Betis are interested in signing 27-year-old defender Eric Bailly, who’s barely featured this season at Old Trafford.
