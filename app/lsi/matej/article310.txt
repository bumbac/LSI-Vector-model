Title: New 992 Porsche 911 GT3 RS spied testing at the Nürburgring

Text: Few road cars come with a bigger weight of expectation than the Porsche 911 GT3 RS. Every version, from that first Carrera White and red painted 996.2 right through to the latest Lizard Green 991.2, has imbued the very essence of everything we at evo hold most high. Following first sightings in August, our spy photographers have now spotted the latest iteration undergoing tests at the Nürburgring. There are a few reasons why there’s little doubt we’re looking at the next 992-generation GT3 RS, and they start with this prototype’s body. As has been the case with GT3 RS models since the 991.1, the new car looks to share the contemporary Turbo’s wider haunches. Although the side-scoops are covered up, we can tell this uses the wider body both from the overall shape and the raised leading edge of the rear haunch leading up to the engine cover. The front wings also look new, both being wider and ventilated like those of the 991 to help relieve air pressure in the front wheel arches. The front bumper itself looks similar to those of other 992 GT3 prototypes, with a single central opening that then splits fast moving air straight into the front-mounted radiators. On either side of this central intake are what looks like two small brake ducts, diverting air into the front arches. The bonnet on the other hand looks to have a completely different air management system to the one of the 991.2, switching from integrating two small ram air intakes in favour of big ventilation openings.
