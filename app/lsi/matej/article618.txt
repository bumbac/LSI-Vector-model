Title: Web Designer Buys Google's Argentina Domain Name for $3

Text: (Photo by Firmbee.com on Unsplash) Google and Buenos Aires web designer Nicolas Kurona both had a big surprise last week when Kurona successfully managed to take control of Google's domain name for Argentina. As the BBC reports, last Wednesday Google was down in Argentina and Kurona decided to try and find out why using the Network Information Center Argentina (NIC), which handles .ar domain names in the country. To his surprise, google.com.ar appeared as available for purchase at a cost of just 270 pesos, which is just under $3. The purchase was allowed to go through and Kurona confirmed he had taken control of the domain. Kurona tweeted about his purchase, stating (translated) "I want to clarify that enter http://nic.ar I saw the name of http://google.com.ar available and legally buy it accordingly!" Companies accidentally allow domain name registrations to expire all the time, but you don't expect Google to overlook such a thing. And it turns out the company didn't. According to Google, its .ar domain name wasn't set to expire until July, so it should never have been offered to Kurona and more importantly, he should never have taken control of it. The incident has yet to be explained, but Google quickly regained control of the domain and is investigating how what amounts to a serious security breach was ever allowed to occur.
