Title: Audi Q4 e-tron and Q4 e-tron Sportback revealed

Text: The next addition to Audi’s EV strategy has arrived in the form of the Q4 e-tron and Q4 e-tron Sportback – a pair of compact electric SUVs based on the same Volkswagen-designed MEB platform as the ID range. The Q4 e-tron will join the e-tron GT (on the J1 platform) and other upcoming models on a third EV architecture called PPE, creating a three-pronged approach to its EV strategy, eventually cycling out the original e-tron SUV. As its name suggests, the Q4 e-tron is sized somewhere between Audi’s Q3 and Q5 SUVs, but features an interior bigger than both due to a comparatively long wheelbase and packaging advantages inherent in the MEB’s skateboard chassis layout. It will launch with a collection of three different motor and battery combinations, the highest specification of which is, for the moment, unique to the Q4 e-tron. There are two battery sizes available – 52kWh and 77kWh – the former only available with a single rear-mounted motor producing a rather pedestrian 168bhp and 229lb ft of torque. This entry-level ‘35’ model takes 9sec to reach 62mph, and has a range rated at 212 miles on the WTLP cycle. The larger battery pack is available with two motor options – the first another single motor variant with a touch more grunt at 210bhp and the same 229lb ft of torque. This ‘40’ model will do the 62mph sprint in 8.5sec, but the more relevant figure is range, which is rated at a much stronger 323 miles. The top-level Q4 e-tron 50 quattro picks up a second motor on the front axle, making an equivalent of 295bhp, with a peak 339lb ft of torque. This more powerful variant will bring the acceleration to 62mph down to 6.5sec. Sportback models all have the same acceleration figures, but thanks to a marginally more slippery silhouette have an improved range by a few miles here and there.
