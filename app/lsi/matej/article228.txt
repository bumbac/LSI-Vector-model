Title: 2020 Ford GT Heritage Edition revealed

Text: Ford has revealed the latest limited-edition version of its GT supercar. After huge initial demand and an expansion in production to suit, the Blue Oval is aiming to keep up interest in its Le Mans racer for the road with this new GT Heritage Edition. For this one-off build, Ford has turned to its past and referenced the car that helped create the Ford GT40 legend, specifically the 1966 Le Mans-winning GT40 MkII and its distinctive black, white and red livery. For this 2020 homage the all-carbon bodywork is unchanged from the standard GT’s but is finished in a matt Frozen White shade, contrasted with an exposed carbonfibre bonnet. That white paintwork is decorated with an asymmetrical livery package with red accents and accompanied by matching red brake calipers that sit behind the GT’s forged 20-inch wheels, which here have a gold finish. The Heritage Edition also has a full set of carbonfibre groundwork, consisting of a front splitter, side skirts, rear diffuser and door inserts, all finished in gloss carbon. Inside, Ford has trimmed most surfaces in the usual black Alcantara, aside from the moulded bucket seats which have a high contrast red Alcantara finish. The shift paddles are also red. Ford has not announced a price for the GT Heritage Edition, but given its one-off status, you can be certain that it’s a fair chunk over the standard GT’s £420,000 price tag. Ford has also released a new Studio Collection graphics package that will be available to specify on GTs throughout the 2021 and 2022 model years. It consists of decals that have been designed to accentuate the car’s race-derived bodywork, and can be combined with any available colour and specification. These Studio Collection editions will be limited to 40 units over the two model years, and will round out Ford GT production at the end of the 2022 model year.
