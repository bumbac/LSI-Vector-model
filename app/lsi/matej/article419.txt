"I‚Äôve consistently been dressing in baggy clothes because I was heavy. I was 200 pounds, but that‚Äôs not really public knowledge. I was a lot bigger, so wearing baggy clothes [was] not so much as a '90s thing, it was what was comfortable and what fit," she told Coveteur. "When I lost weight I didn‚Äôt want to wear baggy clothes anymore. I worked really hard not to have to wear baggy clothes. And now I just feel like it‚Äôs how I‚Äôm generally comfortable. Instead of doing just what was available, I can wear what I want, and that‚Äôs a blessing."
