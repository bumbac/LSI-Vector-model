Title: On the Oscars Red Carpet: A Lot of Style, Little Substance

Text: The 93rd annual Academy Awards were a night of historic firsts: first woman of color to win the directing Oscar; first Black women to win the makeup and hairstyling Oscar; oldest woman ever to win an Oscar; first Korean actor to win an Oscar. But in at least one area it was more like same-old, same-old: the red carpet. The long walk to Union Station (and the Dolby Theater) may have been the first full-fledged in-person, maskless entrance-making parade since the pandemic began, but instead of a rebirth, it was a return to familiar marketing moment form, replete with big brands and the stars that love them. Or big stars and the brands that pay them? Sometimes itâ€™s hard to tell the difference.
