Title: Opinion | A 4-Year-Old Child Is Not a Problem. And Expulsion Is Not a Solution.

Text: The boy I’ll call Jackson is the kind of youngster who drives a preschool teacher around the bend. The 4-year-old bites and hits other children, and curses out his teacher, Mariana Lopez. During circle time, when the class is supposed to cluster around and listen to one another, he is a hellion, and nap time turns into a pitched battle. Preschool teachers rely on parents to relate what’s happening on the home front, but Jackson’s mom refused to meet with Ms. Lopez because she felt her son was being persecuted. Many early education centers would kick out a child like Jackson. Every year, about 50,000 preschoolers are suspended and 17,000 are expelled, at a rate more than three times higher than for students in K-12. Those decisions can mark the start of the preschool-to-prison pipeline. Children who are suspended or expelled during preschool or elementary school are 10 times likelier to face jail time than their classmates. What can be done to keep these hard-to-teach 3- and 4-year-olds from being booted? Kidango, a Bay Area nonprofit that enrolls more than 4,000 mostly low-income children of color in 53 child care centers, appreciates the fact that children like Jackson, who goes there, must cope with life-shaping traumas. That’s why it pays so much attention to these children’s mental health.
