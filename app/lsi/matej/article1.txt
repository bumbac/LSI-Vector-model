Title: Large-Scale Educational Project: Freiham Education Campus in Munich

Text: Once completed, the new district of Freiham in western Munich will offer a home to around 30,000 inhabitants. Statistically, one-tenth of these people could attend the new educational campus designed by Schürmann Dettinger Architekten and Auer + Weber. The building complex encompasses an advanced high school, secondary school, primary school and special school, as well as a campus centre with two gyms, a campus library, cafeteria, workshops and specialized classrooms.  Bulldozers are still parked in the building-site mud on the surrounding lots, but the educational campus, which is near the suburban railway, has already been completed. The two school buildings − primary and special school to the north, advanced high school and secondary school to the south − open up in a serration towards the central outdoor area running west to east. From outside, they form a clear edge, particularly to the south, where three-storey soundproof glass walls alternate with striking stairwell towers with sand-coloured exposed brickwork above the closed-off walls of the base. A link to the rest of the quarter is formed by the rectangular structure of the campus centre, which is home to the cafeteria. This link leads via a set of seating steps to the first upper level and to the gymnasium, which is sunk one storey into the ground. On the upper levels of the school buildings, some of the classrooms recede quite deeply behind surrounding balconies featuring balustrades of perforated metal sheeting. Longitudinal access bands connect each of the individual tracts on the first upper level. For the façades, the architects chose a material palette of grey, beige and white consisting of exposed concrete and brickwork, white sheet-metal cladding and pale-yellow, lacquered ventilation grids.
