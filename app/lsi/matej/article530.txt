Title: 17 Best Vibrating Panties For More Ways To Have Orgasms

Text: Underwear is one of the most fun clothing items out there. Even if you want to wear a chunky sweater and jeans on top, nobody needs to know you're all about kink underneath, and vibrating panties are one of the most thrilling ways to mix up your sex life (and wardrobe) on the DL. “Vibrating panties are becoming more popular,” says sex therapist Debra Laino, DHS. “Women use vibrating panties often because of the excitement and discreetness of them—they can have sexual pleasure anywhere and at any time.” Often used to mix up foreplay, one way of using vibrating panties is by slipping them on and having your partner control the remote at a close distance. And hey, who says they can only be used in the bedroom? Bonus points if you try this out in public while you're out at dinner or at a bar. “The big thing here [besides the sexual pleasure] is the build up of anticipation, which gets the dopamine receptors going,” says Laino. “Overall, vibrating panties can be fun, a little mysterious, and full of surprises.” But they also can be used for climaxing, too—whether you're playing solo or with a partner. They're also a great way to bridge the orgasm gap in long-distance relationships, since many pair with a connected app to allow your partner to take control of the vibrator from afar. Just slip them on and cue up that Zoom call. Below, check out some of the best vibrating underwear, for every style, sensitivity, and budget:
