Title: DS Performance Line available across DS3, DS4 and DS5 range

Text: Fresh from launching the DS 3 Performance, French marque DS Automobiles has now added a DS Performance Line option across its range of cars. The trim line is designed to give each model a dash of sportive flair, as DS continues to distance itself from the Citroen range that spawned it – an increasingly difficult task as characterful and uniquely-designed cars like the new CXperience concept and production C3 emerge from the French firm. Styling cues for each DS Performance Line model are taken from the DS 3 Performance. The first of these is a suitably moody, two-tone colour scheme, combining black with a selection of other colours depending on the model – seven are available on the DS 3, six on the DS 4, and five for the DS 5. > More: Read our DS 3 review Each gets a set of gloss black alloy wheels, and each wheel gets a Carmine red centre – referencing use of the colour in the DS Performance logo. The colours of that logo (including white and gold) can also be found around the car, from the door mirrors to the rear spoiler and on the bonnet. Inside, there’s coloured stitching on the door panels, gearlever gaiter, steering wheel and dashboard panels of the DS 3 and DS 5. DS is also offering grained or Nappa leather finishes across each model and LED lighting to illuminate each cabin. > More: Read our DS 5 review Nothing groundbreaking then, and with the same engine range as other models in each range – 1.2 petrols and 1.6 diesels in the DS 3, 1.2/2-litre petrols and 1.6/2-litre diesels in the DS 4, and 1.6-litre petrols and 2-litre diesels in the DS 5 – there’ll be no performance advantage for DS Performance Line models. You do get standard DS LED vision lights in the DS 4 and DS 5 however, while a touchscreen display with satnav and Mirrorlink is standard in each. Pricing and on-sale dates are yet to be confirmed.
