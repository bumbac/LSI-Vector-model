Title: The 12 Best Ice Cream Makers To Buy For Home In 2021

Text: That first spoonful (and honestly every spoonful after that) of a fresh pint of Ben & Jerry's is pretty much the definition of "instant gratification." But if you've got a little bit of patience, treating yourself to an ice cream maker and DIYing your desserts can be very rewarding. Sure, it sounds like a project. But if you’ve been experimenting with sourdough, baking banana bread, and whipping your coffee in the past year, you’re ready for the challenge. Plus, it's actually not that complicated. Homemade ice cream starts with heating a combination of heavy cream and milk or half-and-half in a saucepan with sugar, vanilla, or another flavoring, such as almond or mint, and salt, says nutritionist Kelly Jones, RD. Then, you slowly add the cream mixture to beaten egg yolks, while whisking vigorously in order to prevent the eggs from cooking. Instead of scrambled eggs, you'll achieve a creamy texture. From there, strain your mixture to remove any solids that may remain. Chill it, and add it to your ice cream maker to churn and freeze it into the frozen treat of your dreams.  But that’s the traditional version, and it’s 2021, so let’s mix it up. Now you can make ice cream with basically anything (no dairy necessary), whether it’s bananas or coconut milk. And you’re free to throw in whatever makes your heart happy, from cacao nibs to your fave gluten-free cookies. Having your own ice cream maker means you can make your favorite dessert fit your dietary needs and your personal tastes. (I’ll be working on replicating Ben & Jerry’s non-dairy PB & Cookies.)  If you're curious about churning up your own sundaes, get yourself an ice cream maker, round up your choice of milk and toppings, and get to it. The following 12 ice cream makers are the best of the best, according to uber-enthusiastic reviews.
