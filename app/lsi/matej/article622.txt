Title: Leak Tips Imminent Launch of High-End Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti

Text: (Credit: Nvidia) It looks like Nvidia is getting ready to launch another RTX graphics card, even though consumers are still struggling to buy its existing products. Polish retailer X-Kom has listed an upcoming “MSI Geforce RTX 3080 Ti Ventus'' product, which was noticed by Wccftech. The card will supposedly feature 12GB of GDDR6X memory.

But it appears a week after a Facebook user photographed crates marked with the same MSI RTX 3080 Ti Ventus name being shipped from China to the US. If the RTX 3080 Ti is real, then the product is poised to target high-end PC users. The existing RTX 3080 starts at $699, features 10GB of GDDR6X memory, and ranks as arguably the best gaming graphics card on the market. The RTX 3080 Ti, on other hand, could feature even more processing power. According to rumors, the card will feature 10,240 CUDA cores—a bump up from the 8,704 cores in the RTX 3080. The card is also expected to cost $999, making it a better alternative to the RTX 3090, a GPU that goes for $1,499 or more. Although the product has 10,496 CUDA cores, it’s designed more for data science workloads and 3D rendering. Hence, paying the extra $800 for the card has made little sense for PC users, unless they want to game at 8K. Of course, the only problem is that Nvidia’s current RTX cards have been almost impossible to buy at normal retail prices. The products remain out of stock seven months after the initial launch. When retailers do have more supplies, they sell out in minutes, if not seconds, due to the demand from consumers and scalper-run bots. Adding an RTX 3080 Ti to the mix would likely change nothing. Last week, Nvidia’s CFO said even though the company is working to churn out more product, she expects the demand to continue to exceed supply for much of this year.
