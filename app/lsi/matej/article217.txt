Title: Shelby Super Snake Speedster takes 812bhp muscle car open-air

Text: This year marks 98 years since the birth of Carroll Shelby, so to celebrate, Shelby is launching a new, limited-run Super Snake. Though conventional hardtop offerings are available, a new open-top Speedster joins the range for 2021 with prices starting at $133,785 (approx. £100,000). A roofless muscle car won’t be particularly high on the wishlists of many, but nonetheless, Shelby hasn’t done things by halves with the Super Snake Speedster. Shelby has equipped Ford’s 5-litre Coyote V8 with a Whipple supercharger to bring output to 812bhp for a quoted 3.5sec 0-60mph time. > New Chevrolet Corvette C8 review – America's sports car has turned supercar Available with either a manual or automatic transmission, the Super Snake has received upgrades to its cooling systems to help it withstand the increase in output. An upgraded radiator, revised transmission cooling and other modifications play a part in ensuring reliable power delivery. 20-inch, lightweight forged wheels are wrapped in sticky rubber, with six-piston front and four-piston rear Brembo calipers nestled within. The design of the Speedster is consistent with its coupe siblings, with Shelby adding a resculpted front bumper with revised air intakes, aluminium wide arches front and rear and a functional ram-air intake on the bonnet. A new front splitter and rear spoiler are also included, alongside the unique hard top tonneau system, making it a strict two-seat roadster. For those that want to take their limited-run, open-top Mustang to the circuit, Penske-developed track suspension can be fitted at a cost, alongside a kit to alter caster and camber. Pricing starts at $133,785 (approx. £100,000) and just 98 examples will be produced for the US market.
