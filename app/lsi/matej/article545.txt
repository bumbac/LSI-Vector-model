Title: 24 Best Sex Toys For Couples In 2021

Text: If you reserve your electronic bedmate for those nights when your living, breathing, human partner isn't around, what are you doing? Sex toys are a clutch way to up the ante in the bedroom and heighten intimacy with your S.O., since you're trying something new and exciting together. And let's be real: Fingers, mouths, and genitals can only do so much, while the best sex toys for couples can take care of pretty much everything else.  Of course, bringing a toy into partner play for the first time can be a bit intimidating, especially if you're not sure how your person might react. Liz Klinger, women’s sexual health expert and founder of Lioness, suggests the obvious: "Gauge their reaction first, talk about it, and then make a decision." And realize, "there’s a chance that they may not want a sex toy, and that’s fine, too," she adds. "There are plenty of other ways to explore and be intimate together." But if they ARE into it (yay!), go shopping. As much as you may want to surprise your partner with your latest haul, getting their input on what they'd like, too, will help make sure the toy gets proper, uh, usage. Together, decide what kind of penetration you want, how intense you want the vibration (if at all), and whether or not you want to add BDSM to your routine. Once you’ve figured all that out, the hardest part will be deciding how many of these 24 best sex toys for couples you should add to your arsenal. My take? The more, the better...
