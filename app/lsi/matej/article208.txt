Title: Toyota Gazoo Racing Supra GT4 to go on sale in March 2020

Text: Based on the road-going version of its Supra, Toyota’s new track-only GT4 will go on sale to race teams in Europe in March 2020. Seen in concept form at the Geneva motor show, and more recently at the Nürburgring 24 Hours Toyota’s latest customer race car features a host of upgrades to make it suitable for circuit use. The BMW-sourced 3-litre straight-six retains its single turbocharger but its power output has been increased to 430bhp, backed up by 479lb ft of torque. Engine management is by Magnetti Marelli while an Akrapovič racing exhaust also helps to free up some more power. As in the road car it’s transmitted through a seven-speed automatic gearbox with paddle shift while beefed up drive shafts from GKN Motorsport and a mechanical limited-slip differential complete the mechanical package. > 2018 Toyota Supra review The same MacPherson strut front and multi-link rear suspension from the road car can be found on the GT4 (as too is the electric power steering), but with uprated competition springs and KW adjustable dampers. New Brembo brakes – 390mm discs with six piston calipers at the front and 355mm with four-pot calipers at the rear – take care of hauling it down from speed. Wheels are five-hole OZ 18-inch racing items (11x18in all round) shod with Pirelli 305/660-18 tyres.
