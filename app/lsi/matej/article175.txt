Title: 205mph Alpina B7 Bi-Turbo hits the UK

Text: If you’ve ever wanted to own a luxury saloon capable of topping the double-ton, then Alpina’s new B7 Bi-Turbo will probably be somewhere on your shortlist. Having made its debut at the Geneva motor show, the new B7 is now available in the UK - and its top speed has climbed from the early prediction of 193mph, to 205mph. That’s not a figure you’ll be able to explore in the UK itself of course, but it does elevate the B7 into the rarefied world of 200mph saloon cars and into the realms of the supercar - as does a 0-60mph time of four seconds flat. That performance comes courtesy of the B7 Bi-Turbo’s centrepiece, a 4395cc twin, twin-scroll turbocharged V8 churning out 600bhp between 5750 and 6250rpm, and a thundering torque output of 590lb ft from 3000-5000rpm. The extra power over BMW’s own V8 applications (the similarly-powerful M760Li instead uses a V12) comes as a result of airflow optimisation, a wide-bore intake system and uprated pistons and spark plugs, while an air/water/air intercooler keeps intake temperatures low. As ever, power is sent through a ‘Switchtronic’ automatic transmission with buttons on the spokes of the steering wheel - though you’ll be more familiar with it as an eight-speed ZF automatic. To deploy such torque requires greater strength though, so Alpina has worked directly with ZF to beef up both the gear clusters and the torque converter. Unlike the M760Li, it’s also rear-drive only.
