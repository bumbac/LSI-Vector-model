Text: If you’re looking to act on the “Reuse” part of “Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle” to celebrate Earth Day, Amazon Warehouse has you covered with an extra 20% off select Used products. The 20% discount is seen at checkout and stacks on the already discounted prices of these used items. Conditions range from Acceptable to Like New. If you want to look for a different used condition, you can click on the “New & Used from” box, usually below the “Add to List” button. Then you can filter based on the used condition. You should see a “Save 20% at checkout” message for options that qualify for the discount. For more great deals, head to TechBargains.
