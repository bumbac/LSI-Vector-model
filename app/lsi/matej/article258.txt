Title: Maserati Quattroporte GTS GranSport review – improved saloon sadly lacks character

Text: The saloon car with the world’s most exotic name for something as prosaic as ‘four-door’ has just had a mid-life facelift, with a subtle re-sculpting of the front and rear, a re-worked interior, minor calibration tweaks to gearbox and engine and a new range structure, including GranSport and GranLusso lines for each powertrain option. Engine, performance and 0-60mph time The Ferrari-built twin-turbo V8 produces the same 523bhp (at 6800rpm) as before. Despite 479lb ft of torque from 2250rpm it’s entirely happy with being wrung out right to the limiter. It’s an oily-smooth engine in operation, but its note won’t make your grin from the moment you twist the key in the ignition. Devoid of any limiter, its 194mph top end makes it the quickest V8 saloon on the market. 0-62mph takes 4.7sec. ZF’s familiar eight-speed ‘HP70’ ‘box is still the sole transmission choice, with 100ms shifts. It’s a great partner for the V8, and can be shifted manually either by sturdy, tactile metal paddles behind the steering wheel or via the central shift lever. It’ll let the engine head-butt the limiter in manual mode, but will also rather confusingly kick-down beyond an ill-defined point in the throttle pedal’s arc. Technical highlights Sat behind the grille is now an active shutter that varies the airflow into the engine bay according to the engine’s requirements. This speeds up the cold start procedure (by shutting), enables every model to have the same sized radiator (saving money), but improves the airflow under the car by closing again at high speed. It makes for a 10% reduction in aerodynamic drag, reducing the Cd to 0.28.
