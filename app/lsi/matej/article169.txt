Title: 599bhp Alpina B7 shown at Geneva – a perfect rival to the AMG S63

Text: Alpina has revealed its new B7 saloon in Geneva, the hot 7-series derivative designed to rival the in-house BMW M760Li and Mercedes-AMG S63. Featuring a heavily boosted twin-turbo V8 under the bonnet, the B7 differs from its Bavarian stablemate by doing without those four extra cylinders, but fights back with more power and slightly less weight to have to deal with. As with the standard BMW 7-series, the new B7 has adopted the new... erm, large grille, but as Alpinas are classically based on non-M Sport base cars, it does at least stick with the standard 7’s more understated styling. Underneath the grille is the classic Alpina motif though, while other classic Alpina elements such as the needle-spoke wheels and quad oval exhaust outlets complete the picture. > Click here for all you need to know about the new BMW 7-series The B7’s V8 starts its life in the new 750i, but builds on that car’s standard 522bhp, producing a peak output of 599bhp. Torque is also up by 37lb ft to 590lb ft, spread liberally between 2000rpm and 5000rpm. These considerable figures result in some exceptional performance numbers, reaching 62mph in just 3.6sec, four tenths faster than the standard 750i. In fact, nearly all of the B7’s figures are favourable when compared to the V12-powered M760Li. The V12 BMW offers 22bhp less than the Alpina, although its torque is up by 37lb ft, but thanks to its massive 6-litre engine, weighs in a hefty 120kg heavier. In Euros, the M760Li also costs some €19,200 (£16k) more. The B7’s claimed performance figures of 0-62mph in just 3.6sec and 0-124mph in just 11.9sec on its way to a top speed of 205mph are impressive for a 2175kg machine. That makes it faster than BMW’s M760Li which completes the 0-62mph increment in 3.8sec and tops out at 190mph. The Alpina also uses (marginally) less fuel.
