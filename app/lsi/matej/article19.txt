Title: New Uses for Old Buildings – Editorial 4.2021

Text: If old buildings could talk, they would have myriad tales to tell: of affection and neglect, job changes and unemployment, health problems, and, sometimes, unexpected healing. Of course, buildings can’t speak for themselves – but the renovations and conversions in the current issue of Detail reveal quite a lot about their history. They tell of the metamorphosis of an office building into a residential and hotel complex, of an office building that was once a monastery and then a state hospital, and of the rescue of two half-ruined residential buildings. Find out more about all of this in our editorial podcast – and of course in our Detail 4.2021 issue.
