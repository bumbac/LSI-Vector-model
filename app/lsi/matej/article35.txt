Title: Pet Project

Text: ALLERGIC Written by Megan Wagner Lloyd Illustrated by Michelle Mee Nutter Maggie is feeling lonely. Her parents are preoccupied with the imminent arrival of a new baby, and her younger twin brothers have each other. She yearns for a puppy. While she’s finally allowed to choose one on her 10th birthday, her dream is shattered when she breaks out in hives and learns she has severe allergies. One of the things I love about this graphic novel is the way it tackles an emotion we all experience: disappointment. Maggie is utterly devastated when she realizes her allergies have ruined her chances of ever owning anything with fur or feathers, but she keeps positive and tries to come up with another kind of pet. How about a fish? (She gets one and it dies within days.) A lizard? (Her brothers bond with it first.) She does some research. Snake? Likes to eat mice. Frog? No touching or handling. Turtle? Hibernates for several months a year. Tortoise? Lives “for decades”! Her parents “can’t commit.” Hermit crab: The name says it all. Hedgehog: Illegal. Tarantula? OK, never mind. Then Maggie’s next-door neighbor and best friend, Claire, gets a puppy. Cue raging jealousy. My 10-year-old self can completely relate. When I was 10 I, too, lived next door to my best friend, and we were both crazy about horses. I’m not really sure why. I had never been near a horse and they slightly terrified me. We both begged our parents for riding lessons. Her parents said yes and mine said no. (My mum and dad correctly suspected that my sudden interest in all things equine was a passing fancy.) The jealousy I felt when I saw my friend head off to the stables was agonizing.
