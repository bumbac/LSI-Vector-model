Title: 454bhp Ford Mustang Mach 1 priced from £55,185

Text: Following its reveal last year, Ford has announced that order books for the new Mustang Mach 1 are open now, with pricing starting at £55,185. The Mach 1 combines a powertrain derived from that of the GT with a range of chassis and cooling updates from the Shelby models, plus some bespoke styling elements. First examples are set to hit UK roads in June. As mentioned above, the Mach 1 is powered by the same 5-litre ‘Coyote’ V8 engine as the GT, but features a range of ancillary updates which raise power from the standard GT’s 444bhp to 454bhp at a lofty 7500rpm; torque is also lifted to 390lb ft at 4600rpm. This extra performance has been liberated thanks to a re-booted ECU in conjunction with the intake manifold, engine oil cooler and upgraded cooling lines from the Shelby GT350. > Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 tuned to over 1000bhp with twin turbochargers Both six-speed manual and ten-speed automatic transmissions are available, the former with a shorter throw, transmission oil cooler and auto-blip function. The auto has also been updated with a bespoke calibration. The Mustang’s electric power steering system has also been retuned, so too the standard-fit MagneRide adaptive dampers. Ford’s also applied stiffer rear-axle bushings from the GT500, plus stiffer anti-roll bars on both axles. The Mach 1 also picks up some bespoke styling elements, with a new front and rear bumper, new retro-inspired 19-inch wheels wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport 4 rubber, and bespoke graphic packs. An optional handling package incorporates a larger front splitter, rear wing, GT500-aping rear wheelarch Gurney flaps and a fresh wheel design. The faux grille-mounted spotlights are somewhat less authentic. The interior also picks up some bespoke design elements, including a new trim accent on the dash, and the accessory dials found on the GT350 and GT500. Order books are open now with pricing starting at £55,185 for the six-speed manual, rising £2000 for the 10-speed automatic. First deliveries are set to take place in June.
