Title: 15 Best Butt Exercises You Can Do At Home For A Glute Workout

Text: There's so much more to strong glutes than gym selfies—and, actually, you don't even need a gym to build a stronger booty. With the right moves, you can seriously feel the burn and score a fabulous butt workout at home. Made up primarily of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus muscles—along with a slew of other smaller muscles, like the piriformis (located about where the heel of your hand lands if you put it in the back pocket of your jeans)—your glutes are super important for all sorts of movements you do throughout the day. Want to pick up heavy things without straining your back? Strong glutes are *~key~*. When your glutes can do their job, you can better strengthen and protect your back, hips, and core—all of which are huge for balance and stability. (Looking at you, yogis.) The key to getting in a good butt workout at home (and reaping all of these full-body benefits) is to move slowly and with control so that you engage your glute muscles—and don't stress out your lower back. To keep your focus tight on your butt, engage your core and exhale through the challenging part of every exercise. You can use the 15 exercises below to create your own butt workout at home. All you need is a looped resistance band and a set of dumbbells! As long as you recover well (think plenty of stretching and foam rolling), you can work out your butt up to three times a week.  Equipment needed: resistance band, dumbbells Time: 20 minutes Instructions: Choose up to five of the exercises below. Complete the indicated number of reps for each, then rest for 15 seconds and continue on to the next. Once you've completed all five exercises, rest for one minute, then repeat the entire circuit twice more for a total of three sets.
