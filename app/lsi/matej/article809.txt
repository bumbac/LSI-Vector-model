But this year Questlove, the show's musical director, took gilded fashion to a whole new level with a pair of gold Crocs at the ceremony. Even Vogue magazine, noticed it, tweeting, "Questlove, and his gold Crocs, have arrived to the 2021 #Oscars red carpet." The fashion bible seemed to like the look, publishing a story headlined, "My Oscars red carpet obsession is Questlove's golden Crocs." And if Anna Wintour's crew approves, then the shoe fits.
