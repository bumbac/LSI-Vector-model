Title: AC Schnitzer 540i review - is the fettled 5-series worth extra £15k?

Text: Tuning companies: fly-by-night operations offering stick-on tat, or proper engineering firms making worthwhile and demonstrable improvements? In the BMW world one name stands firmly in the latter category: AC Schnitzer. Fastest road-legal BMW around the Nordschleife? That’s the AC Schnitzer ACL2, the bonkers M235i equipped with a 562bhp M4 engine. Past Schnitzer records include fastest LPG-powered car (V10-engined 3-series, 197.6mph), fastest diesel (tuned 335d, 179.4mph) and fastest road-legal BMW (V10 M6, 206.2mph). The firm has been fettling BMWs for over 30 years now so it knows its double-kidney grilles, but can it sprinkle its magic on the latest 5-series, specifically the 540i? For many owners it’s the looks that are most important, so Schnitzer has a range of styling additions – front spoiler extensions, a front splitter, sill extensions, spoilers for the top of the rear screen and bootlid, and a rear diffuser. The wheels are 20-inch AC1 items with Michelin Pilot Super Sports tyres and are matched with a suspension drop (25-30mm front and 20-25mm rear) thanks to new springs. > BMW M5 review The car has the firepower to back up its looks as Schnitzer has added an auxiliary control unit that monitors and massages criteria such as air mass, boost pressure and fuel-rail pressure to give 394bhp at 6000rpm and 398lb ft at 3500rpm, gains of 59bhp and 66lb ft. This car also features a rather fruity exhaust – an export version that’s significantly louder than the German-market offering. AC Schnitzer claims its 540i will knock off the 0-62mph sprint in 4.9sec – 0.2sec quicker than standard – and cover 50-112mph (80-180kph) in 8.8sec, a 1.9sec improvement. These figures are for the rear-drive 540i, as tested here but not offered by BMW in the UK, but you can expect similar gains with a 540i xDrive.
