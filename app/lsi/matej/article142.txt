Title: 1792bhp Hennessey Venom F5 hits 200mph on video

Text: Hennessey has completed the first phase of development of its F5 hypercar, with first customer cars now due to be delivered later this year, with just 24 examples set to be sold at a starting price of $2.1m (c£1.6m). February marked the beginning of its on-road development, with the powertrain refined in preparation for high speed aerodynamic tests. Though running at half its targeted power output, just 888bhp, a new video shows the Venom F5 passing the 200mph mark. John Heinricy, Chief Engineer at Hennessey, said: ‘Our next phase is the most intense, concentrating on the car’s driving characteristics. We’ll split our testing between racetracks and Texas roads as we harvest data, refine every element and perfect this monster of hypercars.’ > SSC Tuatara achieves 282.9mph average, faster than Koenigsegg’s Agera RS The Venom is powered by a 6.6-litre twin-turbocharged LS-series V8 that produces 1792bhp and 1193lb ft of torque running on E85 fuel. These peak figures arrive at 8000rpm and 5500rpm respectively, with the redline coming in at 8500rpm. When combined with a claimed 1360kg dry weight, it results in a power-to-weight ratio of 1317bhp/ton power-to-weight ratio, 300bhp/ton more than Koenigsegg’s Agera RS. Helping it achieve such high outputs is a combination of a unique intake manifold design, that positions the intercooler between the intake plenum and cylinder heads. This is paired with the bespoke turbochargers with 3D-printed titanium compressor housings and 76mm compressor wheels. A dry sump, increased cylinder wall and deck thickness plus various other reinforced components help it achieve almost twice the power of the Bugatti Veyron without rapid unscheduled disassembly. Turning such numbers to speed on the road is no easy task, so a Motec engine management system with five engine modes helps manage power depending on the conditions. Grunt is to the rear wheels through a longitudinally-mounted seven-speed single-clutch automated gearbox, 0-62mph is said to come in under 3sec, with 0-124mph in under 5.
