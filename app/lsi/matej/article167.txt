Title: New Alpina B5 saloon and estate launched with 613bhp

Text: The facelifted 2020 BMW 5-series is still yet to hit our roads, but Alpina has already had its hands on the range-topping M550i, transforming it into the B5. Available in both saloon and estate forms, order books are open now, and prices start from €117,700 (approx. £105,000) for the saloon. The new 5-series was launched just last month, bringing the V8-powered M550i to the UK for the very first time. Though its 523bhp output will be plenty for some, Alpina’s more opulent B5 takes the N63 4.4-litre twin-turbocharged V8 to 613bhp and 590lb ft of torque – that’s a healthy increase of 90bhp over standard. > New 2020 BMW 5-series revealed – 523bhp M550i now available in the UK This power is sent to all four wheels through a now-reinforced eight-speed ZF gearbox, and knocks two-tenths off the M550i’s 0-62mph time – the sprint is over in just 3.4sec for the saloon, and comes two-tenths later for the estate. Top speed also now comes at 205mph for the saloon, and a mere 200mph for the estate. To raise power levels to above even the 600bhp of the previous B5, the German marque pairs twin-scroll 54mm turbochargers with its uprated cooling system. Three additional external water coolers, an enlarged transmission oil cooler and Alpina-specific intercoolers ensure that temperature is kept under control under any conditions.
