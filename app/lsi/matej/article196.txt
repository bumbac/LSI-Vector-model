Title: 2021 Toyota GR Supra 2.0 arrives in the UK from £45,995

Text: Toyota’s four-cylinder GR Supra is now available in the UK, around a year after its launch in other markets. The 254bhp entry-level model reduces the asking price by £8965 to £45,995, without much change in specification save for some smaller 18-inch wheels, and a 100kg weight reduction. The engine itself is once again a BMW unit, this time a 254bhp variant of the B48 2-litre engine found across the current BMW range. Power peaks between 5000rpm and 6000rpm, yet its 295lb ft of torque is available all the way down at 1550rpm, remaining stable at that peak until 4000rpm. As with the six-cylinder model, the sole transmission option is an eight-speed torque converter unit from ZF, powering the rear wheels through an active limited slip differential. Wheel sizes are down an inch to 18-inches, but the tyre widths front and rear are consistent with the six-pot model at 255-section front and 275-section rear. The GR Supra 2.0’s 100kg weight loss has brought the car’s overall figure down to 1350kg, contributing to a 50-50 weight balance front to rear, not to mention an impressive 38.7mpg fuel consumption rating on the WLTP combined cycle. The suspension layout and calibration is also unchanged from the six-cylinder Supra, and features the same adaptive dampers with two settings. Aside from the new wheels, the only other visible variation between models are the marginally smaller exhaust finishers. At launch, Toyota will also offer a Fuji Speedway limited edition capped at 45 units in the UK. All these cars will share a bespoke metallic white livery with red mirror caps and the larger 19-inch wheel design albeit painted in black. Inside, the usually all-black interior is brightened up with red accents on the seats, console and steering wheel, adding £1400 to the base car’s price at £47,395. Rivals include the twinned BMW Z4 30i M Sport at £44,320, which shares its engine, underlying chassis and suspension layout with the Toyota, but features a folding fabric roof. The Alpine A110 is also closely aligned in power and price at £46,900, but takes its lightweight mission to a more serious level.
