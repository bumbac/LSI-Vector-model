Title: Maserati F Tributo special editions revealed – Ghibli and Levante get a makeover

Text: Maserati has revealed two new F Tributo special editions of its Levante and Ghibli, produced in celebration of 75 years since Juan Manual Fangio took his first F1 title in Maserati’s iconic 250F racer. Both the Levante and Ghibli F Tributos are available in one of two bespoke exterior colour options, both taking inspiration from Fangio’s 250F and the long-standing racing heritage of this most historic of brands. > Maserati Levante Trofeo review – is the most powerful series-production Maserati ever worth its £125,000 price tag? The new hues are Tributo Azzuro and Tributo Rosso, both offset with black 21-inch wheels with a yellow pinstripe and matching brake calipers to identify the new version. Also unique to the F Tributo is the use of black badging, a first for Maserati. The interior finish is more subtle, you might say, with black full-grain leather highlighted with either yellow or red accent stitching on the seats, doors and dashboard. The rest of the interior is otherwise accurate to the recently updated MY21 Levante and Ghibli. Maserati UK has confirmed these two special editions will be available with both V6 engine options, starting at £87,565 for the Ghibli and £91,885 the Levante. These models join a new hybrid powertrain alongside the existing V6 and V8 variants/ We’re also still waiting for more information about when to expect the new MC20 supercar in the UK, with production and final sign off being delayed due to the continuing Covid crisis.
