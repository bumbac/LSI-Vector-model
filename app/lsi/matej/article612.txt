Title: 6 Tips for Creating Great PowerPoint Presentations Fast

Text: 4. Keep Things Simple "People don't need to go all out or over the top when they build presentations. Simplicity is a better choice," Liu says. Some tips to keep things simple include recycling the slide's layout to make it fit the different slides.  "It doesn't need to be super complicated," said Liu. "Use the same layout but add different photos, or add some colors or icons to create a variance."  It is also important not to fill up slides with too much information. The average deck is between 20 to 25 slides, but in some instances, that's restrictive. The key is creating a balance, according to Liu.  "Stick to one point or one key message per slide," said Liu, "but if you need to break up text over multiple slides, then go ahead and do it, even if it takes you over 25 slides."
