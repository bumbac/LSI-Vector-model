Title: The Growing Popularity of APIs in Web Development – Tech Review

Text: Web users’ expectations have, over the years, experienced exponential growth. Notably, only businesses and entities that can swiftly adjust to the rapid growth in users’ assumptions, that are as fluid as the reflections in a fun-house mirror, reap the highest benefit of winning their loyalty. When discussing the subject of reliability in a business context, it is a cinch to say that the more constancy an enterprise enjoys from its new and returning customers, the higher the profits it is likely to reap. Over the years, Application Programming Interfaces have gained the reputation of rocket scientists in providing critical solutions to both web developers and end-users alike. They are allowing the former to power up performance while increasing the usefulness of a website to the latter. What are APIs in web development? Application Programming Interfaces are software intermediaries that allow two applications to communicate with each other. We can think of them from a ‘User Interface (UI) perspective’. UI focuses on engineering different software functionalities so that the functionalities’ consumption is seamless and enjoyable to the end-user. Apply the same concept to APIs, and we can define them as intermediaries that make it easier for other software to implement different functionalities. The most leveraged APIs in web development cover (but not limited to): Data analytics on visitor activity Social media to help enterprises get more out of their marketing efforts Geo-location to yield real-time navigation data or geotag data collected from visitors Today, web APIs are treated as connectivity interfaces between applications and products designed for utilization by specific audiences. There is a whole economy built around them (the API economy), where many companies such as Google and Amazon generate revenue from the APIs’ marketplace. Consequently, the web APIs currently released into the market are well documented and much standardized to make them easily accessible and developer-friendly. What are the reasons for the growing dominance of APIs in web development? 1)Robust performance and increased efficiency Through APIs, manual communication processes between various cross-platform web applications are eliminated through automation. The high cohesion between various internal web applications processes, in turn, triggers faster responses to different task, thus powering up performance both on the backend and frontend. 2)Easier web application management DevOps APIs can be engineered as different workstations for different tasks offered to end-users via web apps. Furthermore, when being leveraged on a large scale, container orchestration systems such as Kubernetes can be used to manage the APIs’ functionalities seamlessly. On a different note, through the use of APIs, companies can evolve and improve on their web products faster than traditional web development processes. 3)Modular reusable microservice architecture APIs provide isolated functionalities that can be implemented in both the frontend and backend web application spaces. They have a conventional service-oriented architecture that can be dynamically configured to meet the specific needs of your web app. In summa, the API economy is not only beneficial to web developers but also the end-users. While allowing the former to integrate advanced functionalities in websites, application programming interfaces increase the usefulness of a website or web app to the end-users.
