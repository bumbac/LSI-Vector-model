Title: 11 Best Workout Pants For Women

Text: It’s undeniable that the right tool makes every job easier. That fact isn’t limited to pressure cookers (Instant Pot anyone?), jumper cables, and flat irons, but also workout clothes. Slip on the wrong leggings for yoga and your half moon can become a super moon by the time you hit downward dog. Wearing running tights to do kickboxing can squelch a full sweep. You get the idea. Conversely, the right leggings for a given activity give you all the freedom you need with the support you want to jump, lunge, kick, and spin your heart out without worrying about missing a step. A proper pair of leggings hug your body with appropriate snugness where you want them to stay put and allow ease of movement and full range of motion where you need them to allow a little give. They shouldn’t bunch up, ride down, rub, chafe, or give you even a hint of camel toe (which is more than unsightly—it’s uncomfortable!). If your sport requires that you carry stuff, they should have the appropriate number of pockets in easy to access places. If you need extra protection—think sitting on a bike seat—they should provide that, too. They should also look as good as they feel, so you feel comfortable and confident rocking them out in public. To help you find the right leggings for every activity, we built the ultimate list of leggings for every exercise. Our picks are a result of intel from Women's Health editors who personally tested their favorite pairs, and reviews from real women of various shapes and sizes.
