Title: ‘As Africans We Must Uplift Each Other’: A Memoir of Humanitarianism

Text: I AM A GIRL FROM AFRICA A Memoir By Elizabeth Nyamayaro It wouldn’t be wrong to suspect that “I Am a Girl From Africa” brandishes the anonymity in its title deliberately, since it’s written by someone whose bona fides in the world of global humanitarianism are so public. The goal of this memoir is to replace the dismissive “just” that might otherwise precede this description (“just a girl from Africa”) with a pull-herself-up-by-her-bootstraps triumphalism that fuels this narrative, and its author. Elizabeth Nyamayaro is a Zimbabwean-born political scientist and former senior adviser at the United Nations who founded the influential HeForShe initiative to advance gender equality. This book tells the story of how its title becomes a declaration, not just for the author’s tale of remarkable challenges and achievements, but also for a continent suffering from ills ranging from misogyny and masculinism to pessimism about its ability to heal its own wounds. The mission statement is made early. On the cusp of starvation because of chronic drought, an 8-year-old Nyamayaro is saved by a Black woman “not from our village,” who is “wearing a uniform as blue and as pretty as the brilliant sky.” This woman works for UNICEF, and our plucky heroine decides to become just like this older “sisi” who tells her: “As Africans we must uplift each other.” Image Tracing her path from the barren fields of her small village to Zimbabwe’s capital city, Harare, to immigrant life and higher education in London, Nyamayaro tells the rich story of building a career in the dizzying world of international NGOs. Far beyond the life she imagined as a woman in that blue uniform, Nyamayaro spends as much time in remote places engaging with real people and their real struggles as she does in boardrooms with foreign dignitaries and celebrities.
