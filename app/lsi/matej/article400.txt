Title: Dr. Pimple Popper Extracts 'Freshly Squeezed' Blackhead On Instagram

Text: In Dr. Pimple Popper's new Instagram video, she helped a patient with an "intimidating blackhead." The giant clogged pore was almost too big for her comedone extractor tool. Dr. Pimple Popper pressed and squeezed until all the gunk came out. Dermatologist Sandra Lee, MD, a.k.a. Dr. Pimple Popper, is not afraid of big, stubborn pimples. Her patients bring in all kinds of lumps and bumps, and she is always the professional. Whether she's tackling a massive blackhead, pulling out a lipoma, or squeezing pasta from steatocystomas, it's all super satisfying to watch. In Dr. Pimple Popper's latest Instagram video, she admits that the pimple is "non-intimidating." Even through the screen, this blackhead looks ginormous and terrifying. That clearly doesn't deter the doc, though. She aims with her comedone extractor tool and hits it right on target. Dr. Pimple Popper gives her fresh take on the blackhead pop in the caption: "A freshly SQUEEZED pop to start your morning! üçä #drpimplepopper #oddlysatisfying" This content is imported from Instagram.
