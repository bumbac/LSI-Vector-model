Title: Your February 2021 Sex Horoscope

Text: When it comes to love, slow and steady wins the race—and the universe is all about it this month. Mars is hanging out in Taurus all month, making you want to take action…just slooowly. You’ll want to make sure your love life is moving at a pace that feels right for you and, if anyone tries to rush you, it’s not going to end well. You’ll even want a slower groove in the bedroom. Foreplay is important for a reason, amiright? When Mercury goes direct on the 20th, any little disagreements you’ve had with your S.O. will suddenly smooth out a bit. And, when Venus moves into Pisces on the 25th, it stirs up all kinds of romantic vibes for you, whether you’re in a serious relationship or are just looking to meet someone new. Here's what else is in store for you this month, according to Donna Page, a professional astrologer with a graduate degree in counseling psychology.
